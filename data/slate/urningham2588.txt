Urgent times call for urgent conversations as Professor Michele Goodwin and Rebecca Traister join Dahlia Lithwick for an emergency Amicus to discuss what’s new and what’s very old about SB 8, the law that allowed Texas to functionally overturn Roe v. Wade. They also unpack what it really means when five justices on the Supreme Court hold up their hands as if to say “nothing we can do.”Podcast production by Sara Burningham.
