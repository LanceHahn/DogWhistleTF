Seems like the U.S. Capitol Police probably got this one right:The department’s statement is also good for an extremely grim laugh (DNC = Democratic National Committee):Keen indeed! It does seem like the kind of truck one would want to keep an eye on, law enforcement–wise.The statement says the suspect began speaking about “white supremacist ideology” when confronted, but that it’s not yet known whether he was “planning to attend any upcoming demonstrations or if he has ties to any previous cases in the area.” This is an allusion to the right-wing rally called “Justice for J6” planned for this Saturday in the District of Columbia; its purpose is to support the individuals who were arrested and charged for crimes related to the last major right-wing D.C. rally, on Jan. 6 of this year, which culminated with a violent attack on the Capitol building.Speaking of Jan. 6, on Monday, Politico published a teaser from an upcoming book by former White House press secretary and Melania Trump chief of staff Stephanie Grisham. It includes this alleged exchange on the day of the Capitol riot:Despite their rather different personal aesthetics, the former first lady and the white supremacist antler-truck nightmare man are political allies. Her family’s work—enriching itself and punishing perceived enemies—benefits from the collective voting power and physical threat of conspiracy-fueled nationalist rage. At the same time, violent nationalists benefit not just from policies that perpetuate conservative white dominance but (except in extreme cases like this one) the protection afforded by their importance to a major party. It’s at this point the mainstream Republican position, for example, that social media companies shouldn’t try to limit hate speech on their platforms and that states and localities shouldn’t have the right to prevent heavily armed gangs and “militias” from making shows of force in public spaces. That’s coalition politics, baby!
