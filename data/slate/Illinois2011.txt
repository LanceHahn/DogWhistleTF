More than 100 people are feared dead after a tornado outbreak hit at least six states on Friday night. For now the worst affected appears to have been Kentucky, where Gov. Andy Beshear says at least 70 people were feared dead and the death toll could surpass 100. “This will be, I believe, the deadliest tornado system to ever run through Kentucky,” Beshear said. The small city of Mayfield appears to have been one of the worst hit and around 110 people were working in a candle factory there when the tornado struck. Videos and photos show the devastation left behind by the storms that also collapsed an Amazon warehouse in Illinois.
