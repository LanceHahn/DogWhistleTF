On Jan. 6, 2021, after a pro-Trump mob overwhelmed police at the U.S. Capitol and broke into the building, Vice President Mike Pence was taken into hiding by the Secret Service. While this was happening, Donald Trump wrote a tweet attacking Pence (you may remember that Pence had upset Trump by upholding his responsibility to certify the results of the presidential election in a joint session of Congress):I had to copy and paste that text rather than embed the tweet, because it is no longer online.  Twitter suspended and removed Trump—the president!—from its service after more or less concluding that he was using it to try to overthrow the government.This all looked pretty bad in the moment. It looks even worse now! One of the details that emerged from the Capitol that day is that some of the people in the mob said they were looking for Pence; a number of them took part in an unnervingly intense “HANG MIKE PENCE” chant. Trump has since defended this behavior, and Politico reported Wednesday that according to testimony given to the House’s Jan. 6 committee, he approved of the idea of killing Pence at the time, too:This is a tortured description of a thirdhand account, so it’s not clear exactly how much thought and specificity Trump put into his comments. We know from experience that he will kind of nod along and claim to be “strongly looking into” nearly anything that anyone suggests to him. It may not be prosecutorially actionable evidence of conspiracy to commit murder.On the other hand, you have to admit: It’s messed up! And it’s also messed up that this revelation is so unsurprising  that Politico’s story about it is not (currently) among the top five most-read on its website.Messed-up stuff!
