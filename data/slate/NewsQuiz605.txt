Your host, Ray Hamel, has concocted questions on news topics ranging from politics to business, from culture to sports to science.At the end of the quiz, you’ll be able to compare your score with that of the average contestant, as well as with the score of a Slatester who has agreed to take the quiz on the record. This week’s contestant is Daniel Schroeder, the producer of ICYMI.Can you ace the quiz and beat Schroeder? Good luck!If you are one of the masses longing for the return of purple M&M’s, then your prayers have been heard. Sort of. Mars is introducing Purple, a peanut M&M, as a new commercial character, but purple will not be added to the rainbow of peanut M&M’s. I’m hoping Purple sings Prince songs, because purple reigns in the Slate News Quiz.
