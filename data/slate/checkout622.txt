A high water mark for women and the law, followed by a great unraveling. Dahlia Lithwick’s new book Lady Justice: Women, the Law and the Battle to Save America, tells the story of the women lawyers who stood up to Trump and stood up for those unseen and unrepresented by a brutal presidency, and the stories of the women who will fight on in the wake of life-altering decisions from a radicalized Supreme Court.Lady Justice is also available as an audiobook, and Amicus listeners can get a 25 percen discount by entering the code “AMICUS” at checkout.
