HIGHLAND PARK, Illinois—At 10:14 Monday morning, an as-yet-unidentified gunman shot and killed six people at an Independence Day parade in this bucolic North Shore suburb of Chicago. [Update, July 5, 2022, at 10:30 a.m.: A 21-year-old “person of interest” in the shooting has been taken into custody.]Almost five hours later, the streets are cordoned off and empty except for police officers, media members, and a few oblivious cyclists who, one by one, slow to a halt at the corner of St John’s Avenue and Central Avenue, gaze at the taped-off downtown area, and ask what happened here. Abandoned parade chairs and baby strollers line the sidewalks, a short walk from where the shooting happened. As 3 p.m. approaches, the previously sunny skies are darkened by storm clouds. A police officer says investigators are scrambling to secure evidence before the rain washes it away. A short time later, a light drizzle starts to fall.Below, photos from the scene in Highland Park on Monday, in the interim period after the shooting and before the suspect was captured.
