Politics, politics, politics. While we all wait for Tuesday night’s election results, what else is happening in politics?Ah:That was Monday night. (John F. Kennedy Jr. died in 1999 in a plane crash but, for some reason I promise never to learn, is believed to have faked his own death by certain “Q” conspiracy theorists, who as a whole believe that Donald Trump is engaged in an epic and clandestine effort to punish a wide range of American politicians and celebrities for their secret perpetration of pedophilia and cannibalism.)Tuesday, as promised, they showed up:To answer your questions: Yes, those X’s are supposedly where John F. Kennedy was shot while riding in a motorcade with his wife and Texas Gov. John Connally in 1963. And yes, according to a Twitter DM I got from Steven Monacelli, while none of the Q believers he spoke to “would say exactly how they expect [JFK Jr.] to show up,” they did “seem to be gathering along the side of the road as if a motorcade were going to arrive any moment.” (Here is a page where you can find more of Monacelli’s work.) Also, for the record, the gathering appears to have dispersed without any Kennedy sightings.Now, are we having some fun “laughing at the wackos” here who were waiting for a dead person to reveal himself in, for some reason, a manner that would re-create his own father’s death? Yes. Are we blowing a few fringe oddballs into being a bigger deal than they really are? Not really! Across the country, Republican legislators and candidates with open QAnon ties—here are recent examples from Michigan and Arizona—are seeking offices in which they would have input into election administration and vote counting. And many political observers are currently projecting that voters across this country will sweep the party that these people belong to back into power in the 2022 midterms!It’s really something. I’m going to move my family to the moon!
