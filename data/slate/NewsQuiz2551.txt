Welcome to Slate’s weekly news quiz. It’s Friday, which means it’s time to test your knowledge of the week’s news events. Your host, Ray Hamel, has concocted questions on news topics ranging from politics to business, from culture to sports to science.At the end of the quiz, you’ll be able to compare your score with that of the average contestant, as well as with the score of a Slatester who has agreed to take the quiz on the record. This week’s contestant is commerce production associate Cleo Levin.Can you ace the quiz and beat Levin? Good luck!Those who think horse dewormer will ward off COVID are taking advice from the wrong TV “expert.” “Go right to the source and ask the horse/ He’ll give you the answer that you endorse/ Prescribes the ivermectin course/ Talk to Mr. Ed.” Or is that now Dr. Ed? You’ll need more than good horse sense for this week’s Slate News Quiz.
