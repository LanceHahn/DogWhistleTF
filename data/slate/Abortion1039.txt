On Sunday, many Christian churches across the country will celebrate the news of Roe’s end with sermons lauding the monumental victory for life. Already on Twitter we can see a preview of what’s to come. Some nascent debates among Christians there have begun to form: whether to address ways to help pregnant mothers, whether to begin talking about the next legal and cultural battlegrounds, whether to reach out for common ground with the pro-choice side or look for ways to soothe the national anguish.But, with some exceptions from more progressive groups, the immediate reaction from many Christian leaders to Dobbs has been triumphant.While religious Americans are by no means uniform in opposing abortion (a majority of Catholics, for example, believe abortions should be legal in all or most cases), the political power for the pro-life movement has been driven by white evangelicals, while Catholics have historically provided the movement’s intellectual scaffolding. So the most visible and influential responses have been from those Christians who fought to get us here.Nodding to that fight, many major organizations have released statements that touted the historical nature of the ruling, while still reminding the public of the work left to do.Bart Barber, the president of the Southern Baptist Convention:Archbishop José Gomez of Los Angeles, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops:Walter Kim, the president of the National Association of Evangelicals:Individual faith leaders and more overtly political groups were less restrained in relishing their win.James Dobson, former Focus on the Family leader:The Conservative Baptist Network, the conservative faction inside the SBC:Jim Daly, president of Focus on the Family:CatholicVote, a conservative Catholic political group:Jeff Hunt, director of the Centennial Institute at Colorado Christian University:Rick Warren, founder and senior pastor of Saddleback Church, a megachurch in Lake Forest, California:Some released statements that highlighted the justices’ heroism in the face of pressure from the left.Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council:Others hinted at what might come next.Bill Donohue, president of the conservative Catholic League, teased a fight over emergency contraceptives:The far-right publication Church Militant was also eyeing contraceptives:But there were those among the pro-life faction who took the time to remind their followers of the pain that their victory would cause, and the responsibility they had to face that pain.As Timothy Dalrymple, the president and CEO of Christianity Today, the flagship magazine of American evangelicalism, put it:For more on religion’s role in the abortion debate, listen to an episode from this season of Slow Burn on a Catholic couple from Cincinnati who kickstarted the right-to-life movement with their Handbook on Abortion.
