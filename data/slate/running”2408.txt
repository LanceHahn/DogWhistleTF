On Monday, the Washington Post’s Michael Scherer and Josh Dawsey reported that Donald Trump has been so itching to become a candidate for president in 2024 that he almost announced in August, two and a half years before the start of the Republican primaries. What stopped him?According to the Post, he was told that his unpopularity might help Democrats and cost Republicans in the 2022 midterms, thus harming his candidacy down the line:Or, to put it another way, the 2020 loser was told that he could cause his party to lose in 2022, thus potentially setting him up to be a big sad loser again in 2024. Apparently, that case worked on Trump. From the Post:Trump seeming to understand and accept that he could do more harm than good to his party’s chances in 2022 if he makes the midterms about himself might seem like a shocking level of self-awareness from a man who has spent the past 11 months spreading the lie that he won the last election and demanding that all Republican candidates for future elected office vindicate that claim or be purged from the GOP. However, according to the Post’s reporting, it seems that deep down Trump may know how deeply unpopular he is:Indeed, part of Trump must surely know that he wouldn’t have had to go to such great lengths to try to nullify and overturn the 2020 election—and continue to this day to try to convince his followers that the election was stolen from him—if he wasn’t so loathed by such a large plurality of the American people.While the Post reports that Trump has used his 2024 shadow campaign to bolster fundraising from small donors and large donors alike in recent months and to intimidate potential rivals from moving forward with their own potential campaign plans, it also reports that the Republican donor class would prefer the insurrectionist in chief not make a third run because of how big of a loser he has been:Still, Trump’s apparent acknowledgment for the moment that making the 2022 elections a referendum on a potential 2024 Trump candidacy can only hurt the Republican Party and his odds of returning to power is not stopping him from taking every practical step to keep a lock on the GOP  nomination the next time around. Indeed, the Post reports that Trump has hired a pair of Republican strategists who have deep ties to the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucus. Trump has also reportedly been pushing behind the scenes for “no changes to the nomination calendar in 2024, leaving Iowa, where he came in second in 2016, as the first-in-the-nation caucus for Republicans even if Democrats decide to go a different route.”Trump apparently sees Iowa as the likely site of his political comeback: He is actually planning a rally there this Saturday in the wake of a new poll showing that 53 percent of Iowans now have a favorable opinion of the former president, his strongest showing in the state ever.Indeed, just because Trump can, for the moment and in his own self-interest, restrain himself from announcing a candidacy that will inevitably backfire if it comes too early, doesn’t mean he’s not planning on subjecting the country to another round of Trump campaign psychodrama—and another outright attack on democracy—in 2024.As the Post notes, he is “constantly” telling people, “I’m running.”
