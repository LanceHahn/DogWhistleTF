Welcome to Slate’s weekly news quiz. It’s Friday, which means it’s time to test your knowledge of the week’s news events. Your host, Ray Hamel, has concocted questions on news topics ranging from politics to business, from culture to sports to science.At the end of the quiz, you’ll be able to compare your score with that of the average contestant, as well as with the score of a Slatester who has agreed to take the quiz on the record. This week’s contestant is executive producer of podcasts Alicia Montgomery.Can you ace the quiz and beat Montgomery? Good luck!Music fans mourn the deaths of Tom T. Hall and Don Everly, who died one day apart this week. On a trivial note, they had rhyming song titles: Hall in 1973 with “I Love,” and Don and his brother, Phil, in 1957 with “Bye Bye Love.” Love is all around the Slate News Quiz.
