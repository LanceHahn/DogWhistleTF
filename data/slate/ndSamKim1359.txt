Although church and state are supposed to be separate, white evangelical power is a potent force in American politics. And it has historically been used to battle against racial equity. On todayâ€™s episode of A Word, Jason Johnson is joined by Professor Anthea Butler, the author of White Evangelical Racism: The Politics of Morality in America. They discuss the resurgence of white evangelical influence in politics, and why so much of that movement has been focused on thwarting civil rights for African Americans.Guest: Anthea Butler, chair of the Religious Studies Department at the University of PennsylvaniaPodcast production by Jasmine Ellis and Sam Kim
