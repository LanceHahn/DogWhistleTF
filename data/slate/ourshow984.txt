Dorothy is the author of Torn Apart: How the Child Welfare System Destroys Black Families, and How Abolition Can Build a Safer World, and of Killing the Black Body: Race, Reproduction, and the Meaning of Liberty.Then, Dahlia talks to Amy Westervelt of Drilled podcast to find out what EPA v West Virginia means for climate action, and the places the Biden Administration could still make progress.For a behind the scenes look into some of the articles we read when we create the show, check out our Pocket collection at http://getpocket.com/slate.Slate plus listeners will also have access to Dahlia’s conversation with Mark Joseph Stern, where they dig into some of the cases we couldn’t reach in the main show, including the Remain in Mexico decision and the alarming implications of the court taking up Moore v.
