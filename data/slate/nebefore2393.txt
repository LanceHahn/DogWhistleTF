Welcome to Slate’s weekly news quiz. It’s Friday, which means it’s time to test your knowledge of the week’s news events. Your host, Ray Hamel, has concocted questions on news topics ranging from politics to business, from culture to sports to science.At the end of the quiz, you’ll be able to compare your score with that of the average contestant, as well as with the score of a Slatester who has agreed to take the quiz on the record. This week’s contestant is the producer of the podcast ICYMI Daniel Schroeder.Can you ace the quiz and beat Schroeder? Good luck!At age 90, William Shatner, aka Captain Kirk, will become the oldest person to fly into space aboard the next Blue Origin tourist spaceflight on Tuesday. Next up, I suggest actress June Lockhart—Maureen Robinson on Lost in Space—who would shatter the record at age 96. The Slate News Quiz boldly goes where no quiz has gone before.
