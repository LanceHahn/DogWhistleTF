In light of the Uvalde school shooting, weâ€™re rebroadcasting a special audio presentation from Amicus that originally aired in 2018, after the Parkland shooting. Dahlia Lithwick spoke to three educators who survived gun violence at their schools. Heather Martin was a student at Columbine during the 1999 mass shooting; Mary Ann Jacob was library clerk at Sandy Hook at the time of the 2012 shooting; and Ken Yuers was a teacher at Rancho Tehama Elementary School when it suffered a school shooting in 2017. They discussed what they experienced, what it was like going back to the classroom, and what they want changed.Amicus is produced by Sara Burningham.
