What’s this now that’s been published in the Jan. 18 issue of the scientific journal PLOS ONE?That’s certainly—well, let’s look into it a little more closely.Huge crocodile mummies … previously undisturbed tomb … hmm. To be sure,  biological and archaeological research is not only essential—it’s a critical part of how we understand being human. Let us, perhaps, only hope that no one treated this tomb with disrespect before it was opened from an ancient slumber.OK, the Byzantines put garbage on it for like a thousand years. That is not friendly or neighborly. Do these specimens have any additional reasons to be upset?An estimated 2,500 years of bony inflammation irritating one’s pubis is, simply put, not a good scene. That is going to be an ornery creature if it is jolted back to life when lightning strikes the laboratory where it’s being stored, at midnight, under the light of the so-called “necropolis moon.”What else? Do we have any idea how these crocodiles might have been captured and killed?Wow, just a really normal situation from start to finish here. So, in any case, the point is that apparently these animals were likely desiccated by being buried, then mummified using strips of linen or palm leaves, then entombed at a site that is possibly associated with the cult of the crocodile fertility god Sobek. And what the academics studying them are hoping to find out is—okay, you’re still talking:Pass. No.That will be all from you, scientific journal PLOS ONE.
