Your host, Ray Hamel, has concocted questions on news topics ranging from politics to business, from culture to sports to science.At the end of the quiz, you’ll be able to compare your score with that of the average contestant, as well as with the score of a Slatester who has agreed to take the quiz on the record. This week’s contestant is staff writer Aymann Ismail.Can you ace the quiz and beat Ismail? Good luck!A Danish artist, loaned $84,000 cash by a museum to use in a pair of artworks, instead turned in two empty canvases under the title Take the Money and Run. That’s almost like going on tour billed as the Rolling Stones without drummer Charlie Watts. The Slate News Quiz is the real deal.
