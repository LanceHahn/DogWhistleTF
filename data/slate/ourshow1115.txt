Dahlia Lithwick is joined by Ryan Goodman, professor of law at NYU and co-editor-in-chief of Just Security. While we wait for the high court to release opinions in a heaving pile of cases, the main constitutional action of the week was in Congress. Ryan Goodman has been piecing together the events of Jan. 6, and what led to it, for the past year and a half with colleagues at Just Security and Protect Democracy. Goodman leads Dahlia through what we heard from the Jan. 6 select committee on Thursday night: what was new, what was big, and the emerging road map for Attorney General Merrick Garland.In this week’s Amicus Plus segment, Dahlia and Slate’s Mark Joseph Stern run down the SCOTUS decisions we got this week—including a stunning decision this week allowing border agents almost limitless protection from lawsuits for bad behavior.Sign up for Slate Plus now to listen and support our show.
