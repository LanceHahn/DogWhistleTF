President Joe Biden joined his wife Jill Biden at Walter Reed National Medical Center on Wednesday ahead of a minor skin surgery for the first lady.The White House said Jill Biden would get Mohs surgical procedure to remove a small lesion above her right eye but did not say whether the president would receive any medical attention during the visit.Although it appears that Biden traveled with the First Lady to provide moral support, his trip could indicate some sort of medical treatment for the president.Typically, White House officials keep any medical details of the president from the press, and use seemingly meaningless visits to the hospital to conduct medical procedures outside of the public eye.The president has not released any details of his annual physical exam even though he said he would get it finished by the end of the year.Marine One, carrying U.S. President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden, approaches to land at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland on January 11, 2023.
