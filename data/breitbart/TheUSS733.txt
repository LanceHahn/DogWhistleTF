The U.S. State Department is pretending to offer grants for proponents of free speech while disqualifying anyone who disagrees with their woke agenda.If your “speech” promotes biological males playing women’s sports, abortion-on-demand, and the sexual indoctrination of six-year-olds, the State Department is offering $750,000 grants to help you stamp out the free speech of anyone who disagrees with you.Secretary of State Antony Blinken on January 18, 2023, in Washington.

Ron DeSantis (R), especially his resistance to child sexual indoctrination, since he appears to be a probable threat to a Democrat run for the White House in 2024.Florida Gov.
