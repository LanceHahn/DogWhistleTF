Joe Biden has given these lunatics unchecked power. I will have them fired and escorted from the building, and I will tell Congress that any appropriations bill I sign must reaffirm the president’s ability to remove defiant employees form the job. It’s all about our children. I will veto the sinister effort to weaponize civics education. We will keep men out women’s sports and we will create a new credentialing body that will be the gold standard anywhere in the world to certify teachers who embrace patriotic values, support our way of life, and understand that their job is not to indoctrinate children, but very simply to educate them.Lastly, school districts and states that “abolish teacher tenure from grades K-12,” “cut the bloated number of school administrators,” “Adopt a parental bill of rights,” and establish elections for school principals by parents at the local level will be rewarded with “massive funding preferences and favorable treatment.”pic.twitter.com/SOlGwaRCJf— Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom) January 27, 2023“When I’m president, we will put parents back in charge and give them the final say. We will get back to teaching reading, writing, and math called arithmetic, and we will give our kids the high-quality, pro-American education they deserve,” Trump concluded.
