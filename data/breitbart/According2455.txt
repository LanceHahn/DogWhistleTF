According to new files released by Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry via his multi-state censorship lawsuit against the Biden administration, the White House requested that Facebook censor Fox News’ Tucker Carlson for expressing criticism of COVID-19 vaccines.In an email sent to a Facebook employee on April 14, 2021, White House Director of Digital Strategy Rob Flaherty wrote, “Since we’ve been on the phone – the top post about vaccines today is Tucker Carlson saying they don’t work. Yesterday it was Tomi Lahren saying she won’t take one.”Rob Flaherty told facebook to censor @tuckercarlson pic.twitter.com/XcuzwAMe6E— Jeff Landry (@JeffLandry) January 7, 2023The emails are the latest in a string of revelations about the extent of collusion between the Biden Administration and tech companies to suppress coronavirus debate.Mark Zuckerberg surrounded by guards ( Chip Somodevilla /Getty)President Joe Biden speaks to the press as he stops for ice cream in Portland, Oregon, on October 15, 2022.
