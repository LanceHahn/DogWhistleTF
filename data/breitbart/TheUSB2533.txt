The U.S. Bishops’ Conference (USCCB) has decried the lifting of safety protocols on chemical abortions, calling the measure a “tragedy” for the preborn and “harmful to women in need.”On Tuesday, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that retail pharmacies will now be able to distribute the chemical abortion drug RU-486 (mifepristone) by prescription through a simple certification process.Prior to the FDA decision, the distribution of RU-486 was often restricted to specially qualified licensed physicians and in 19 states, the prescribing clinician was required to be physically in the room with the patient while she was taking the drug to monitor the situation.Arlington Bishop Michael Burbidge, chairman of the Bishops’ Committee on Pro-Life Activities, issued a statement this weekend condemning the decision, which comes in the wake of last June’s Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade.The Plan C website on a smartphone arranged in the Brooklyn borough of New York, US, on Thursday, Oct. 27, 2022.

They deserve better,” he states.Follow @tdwilliamsrome
