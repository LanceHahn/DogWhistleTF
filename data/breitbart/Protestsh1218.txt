Protests have begun across the country after Memphis officials released the video footage of the traffic stop that resulted in the death of 29-year-old Tyre Nichols.Nichols, a 29-year-old black man, died on January 10, three days after Memphis police officers stopped him for “reckless driving.”In an initial statement, the Memphis Police Department said Nichols “complained of having shortness of breath” after “another confrontation occurred” between Nichols and law enforcement.On Friday, Memphis officials released video footage from the traffic stop that showed officers shouting expletives and repeatedly punching Nichols as they attempted to detain him.In Memphis, protesters demonstrated on the highway and blocked the flow of traffic.“Holding up traffic ain’t gon’ do nothing,” one trucker stuck on the highway said.Trucker pleads with protesters to clear the highway as protesters line up and stop traffic.
