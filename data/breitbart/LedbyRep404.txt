Led by Rep. Tom McClintock (R-CA) on the anniversary of Iran’s 1979 “anti-dictatorial” revolution, House lawmakers introduced a broad bipartisan resolution in support of a free, democratic, secular, and non-nuclear republic in Iran, with over 160 cosponsors.During a press conference honoring the introduction of H. Res. 100 on Wednesday, Congressman McClintock said it “expresses our united support for the Iranian people in their struggle for a democratic, secular, and nonnuclear Republic of Iran” while condemning the “violations of human rights and the state-sponsored terrorism” of the Islamic regime.🚨McClintock Introduced House Resolution With Over 160 Co-sponsors in Support of a Free, Democratic, and Secular Republic in Iran: https://t.co/mxT4q2rsC9— Tom McClintock (@RepMcClintock) February 9, 2023He described the “passion for freedom” of the Iranian people as “an inspiration to all who know them.”“Their commitment to liberating Iran is what brings us here today,” he said, adding that “without these freedom fighters both here, around the world, and most importantly, within Iran, this growing, resolute and determined resistance movement would not be possible.”#LIVE: Congressional Press Briefing | Supporting  a Secular, Democratic, Non-Nuclear Republic of Iran#IranRevolution #IranProtestshttps://t.co/1Ulkn36kif— OIAC: Organization of Iranian American Communities (@OrgIAC) February 8, 2023The resolution recognizes that the Iranian people “are rejecting monarchic dictatorship and religious tyranny” and opting “to establish a democratic, secular, and non-nuclear” state in its stead.It also urges the U.S. to “be involved in any establishment of an international investigation into the 1988 extrajudicial killings” of thousands of political prisoners in Iran, while calling on relevant U.S. government agencies to “work with European allies, including those in the Balkans where Iran has expanded its presence, to hold Iran accountable for breaching diplomatic privileges, and to call on nations to prevent the malign activities of the Iranian regime’s diplomatic missions, with the goal of closing them down and expelling its agents.”Rep.

Randy Weber (R-TX) expressed feeling “horrified by the paranoid regime’s brutal repression of its own freedom loving citizens.” “But all these evil doers should be paranoid, shouldn’t they?” he added.I was proud to stand with my colleagues today to recognize the rights of the Iranian people and their struggle to establish a democratic, secular, and nonnuclear Republic of Iran. https://t.co/xQWpbmCKb1— Randy Weber (@TXRandy14) February 8, 2023The Texas Republican also stated he applauds “all who are demanding an end to the totalitarian regime and seeking a form of governance that derives its legitimacy from the people, not from an unelected dictatorial single party.”“It’s time for that to be over,” he asserted. “We know America recognizes this time for that to be over.”In an exclusive statement to Breitbart News, Dr. Majid Sadeghpour, the political director of the Organization of Iranian American Communities (OIAC), which is dedicated to the “promotion of a free and democratic Iran,” said the “unprecedented” bipartisan resolution — which “denounces the Shah’s ruthless and corrupt dictatorship and the current ruling religious tyranny” while supporting the “call for a secular, non-nuclear Iranian Republic” — should serve as a “compass for Washington to adopt the right policy on Iran.” Addressing Wednesday’s briefing, NCRI head Maryam Rajavi declared that now, “after more than 40 years of repression and resistance, the Iranian nation is ready again to overthrow another form of dictatorship” in order to “establish a democratic, pluralistic and secular republic.”“What you see in Iran today is another revolution in the making,” she added.In this photo taken by an individual not employed by the Associated Press and obtained by the AP outside Iran shows students of the Sharif University of Technology attend a protest sparked by the death in September of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in the custody of the country’s morality police, in Tehran, Friday, October 7, 2022. (AP Photo)The matter comes as massive protests continue to sweep Iran following the September death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini while in the custody of the Islamic theocracy’s notorious “morality police” for violating strict requirements for women to keep their heads covered in public.Amini was reportedly abducted and killed by the force for having exposed some hair from beneath her mandatory Islamic headscarf.Iranian officials have unconvincingly claimed she died of natural causes after the patrol stuffed her in a van and carted her off to a grim detention center. However, her family insists she had no life-threatening health problems. Since then, a slew of incidents involving abuses and even deaths at the hands of the regime have been documented amid an ongoing clampdown on protests, with clips circulating showing Iranian regime officers brutally assaulting protesters.The international community must take urgent action to stop further executions in Iran. pic.twitter.com/zsH4RHwWtL— Amnesty International (@amnesty) January 11, 2023In October, representatives of Iran’s parliament in exile, the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) claimed Iran — the largest state sponsor of terrorism worldwide — is currently witnessing a revolution “in the making,” with the Islamic Republic no longer capable of containing the current uprising.Follow Joshua Klein on Twitter @JoshuaKlein.
