The Pentagon may have “deliberately” hidden information from then-President Donald Trump about Chinese spy balloons roaming above the United States over fears Trump would act immediately and “aggressively” in response, according to Rep. Mike Waltz (R-FL), a member of the House Armed Services Committee whose suggestion comes in the wake of his briefings with former officials.Joining FOX Business host Stuart Varney on Monday, Waltz, who serves on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, addressed reports that Chinese spy balloons previously flew over the U.S. during the Trump administration, calling it a “spin on the Biden White House’s part” in order “to say, ‘Well it happened back then, they didn’t shoot it down,’ and therefore to justify their dithering inaction here.”Noting his office “has been briefed by the office of the Secretary of Defense of the current Pentagon” that past incidents of Chinese spy balloons traversing the country under the previous administration “happened before,” Waltz maintained that the matter leaves open “more detailed questions,” such as: “Did the Pentagon under the Trump administration brief the Trump White House and give them the option to take action or did they decide not to brief them for whatever reason?”After briefing with Trump White House officials over the weekend, Waltz described “speculation” that the Pentagon “deliberately” did not inform then-President Trump over the matter because they feared his response “would be too provocative and too aggressive.”“So that’s what we need to get to the bottom of,” he said.Waltz, a colonel in the National Guard as well as a former White House and Pentagon policy adviser and the first Green Beret to be elected to Congress, also noted that he is still awaiting comments by Gen. James Mattis, who served as Secretary of Defense during that time period.“What did he know and what did he decide to pass on and brief to the president?” the congressman asked.On Sunday, former President Trump denied claims by the Department of Defense (DoD) of previous incursions of Chinese spy balloons during his term.Many other former senior officials also denied the claims.In this photo provided by Brian Branch, a large balloon drifts above the Kingstown, NC, area, with an airplane and its contrail seen below it.
