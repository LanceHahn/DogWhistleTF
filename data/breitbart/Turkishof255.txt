Turkish officials have detained 130 people allegedly involved in illegal construction methods as rescuers on Sunday looked to extricate more survivors of last week’s devastating earthquakes now estimated to have claimed more than 33,000 lives.AP reports the death toll from the 7.8 magnitude and 7.5 magnitude quakes that hit south-eastern Turkey and northern Syria nine hours apart on Feb. 6 rose to 33,179 on Sunday.Officials and medics said the total is made up of 29,605 people who died in Turkey and 3,574 in Syria from Monday’s 7.8-magnitude quake.Tens of thousands of people have also been left homeless.A tent camp for earthquake victims has been set up in the stadium of the provincial capital with tents from the Turkish disaster management authority AFAD. Almost a week after the earthquake disaster in the Turkish-Syrian border area, the number of dead has risen to more than 30,000.
