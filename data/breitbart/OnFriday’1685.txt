And the Biden administration is, no enemies whatsoever to the left ever. We will never say anything but this is essential, obvious, and we should trans[ition] students as soon as possible. And it’s just — I don’t even think Biden is that behind this, but he’s certainly controlled by people who are.”Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC) then stated, “Well, medical schools are behind this, actually. We’ve read stories about –.”Maher cut in to state, “Yes. And that’s the problem is that –.”Mace added, “They’re training these medical students to say that puberty blockers are reversible, they are not.”Maher responded, “Right.
