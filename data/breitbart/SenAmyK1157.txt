Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D) posted a video to Twitter on Saturday in which she pushed an “assault weapons” ban in response to two shootings carried out with pistols.Klobuchar cited the January 21, 2023 Monterey Park shooting (11 killed) and the January 23, 2023 Half Moon Bay shooting (seven killed).She did not mention that both shootings occurred in stringently gun-controlled California, which has had an “assault weapons” ban since the 1990s. Nor did she mention that both shootings were carried out with pistols.Klobuchar did, however, push for more gun control.Thinking of those lost to gun violence this week. Enough is enough. pic.twitter.com/gXKwaLrkoz— Amy Klobuchar (@amyklobuchar) January 28, 2023Breitbart News reported that California Gov.
