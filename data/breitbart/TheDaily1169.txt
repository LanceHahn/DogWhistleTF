Another suspect was alleged present as well.The homeowner’s girlfriend was with him and, fearing for her life and his own life too, he drew his gun and fired, hitting Washington with four rounds.FOX 13 noted Washington allegedly fled the scene after being shot, “but officers quickly caught up with…[him].”The second suspect fled as well and had escaped capture as of Sunday morning.Breitbart News pointed out Haines City police chief Greg Goreck responded to the incident by saying, “When a person breaks the sanctity of a person’s home, the average person would rightly conclude their purpose was evil. The homeowner had every right to take the action he did in this case based on the circumstances.”Goreck added, “We live in Florida…most people are armed.”AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.
