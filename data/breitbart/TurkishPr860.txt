Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has stated that unless Sweden bans the burning of the Islamic Qur’an, he will not agree to the country’s bid for membership in the NATO military alliance.President Erdogan stated this week that Turkey will refuse to give a green light for Swedish membership in NATO as long as it remains legal for people to burn copies of the Islamic holy book following a recent burning of the Qur’an last month.“As long as you allow my holy book, the Qur’an, to be burned and torn apart, we will not say yes to your entry into NATO. Our view of Finland is positive, but not of Sweden,” Erdogan said, broadcaster SVT reports.

That being said, I fully understand that people are offended by the burning of holy scriptures, and find it deeply hurtful.

I am not surprised by this reaction,” and added it is not possible to change laws on burning the Qur’an quickly.Turkey Demands Sweden and Finland Hand Over 130 Alleged Terrorists in Return for NATO Membershiphttps://t.co/oC5lqqwDPC— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 17, 2023
