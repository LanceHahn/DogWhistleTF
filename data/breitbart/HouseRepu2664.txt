House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) has offered several proposals to House conservatives to garner their votes to make him speaker.As the battle for speaker drags on into the third day of the new congressional term, McCarthy has made an increasing number of offers to persuade conservatives to back his bid for speaker.On Wednesday night, McCarthy offered conservatives:The conservative activist group Club for Growth and the Congressional Leadership Fund (CLF), a super PAC aligned with McCarthy, struck a deal to prevent CLF from weighing in on any open-seat primaries in safe Republican districts.Rep. Warren Davidson (R-OH) outlined many of the concessions that McCarthy has given conservatives:Breitbart News’s Nick Gilbertson reported:Among other adoptions, Davidson cited the revival of the Holman Rule and “an end to the Gephardt rule” to reign in runaway debt, as well as a new rule worked out with Rep. Morgan Griffith (R-VA) on single subject bills that Davidson said the GOP hopes “to call the Griffith Rule.”Additionally, he highlighted the promise of “diverse viewpoints on every committee” and a “Church-style commission” attached to the Judiciary Committee, set to be chaired by Rep Jim Jordan (R-OH), to investigate collaborations between the government and big tech “to silence, persecute, or even prosecute our fellow citizens.”McCarthy has been negotiating for months with House conservatives on several of their proposed rules reforms. On Sunday, before the speaker votes, McCarthy released a rules package containing many victories for House conservatives.The rules package on January 2 included:McCarthy has also promised to avoid the closed-door negotiations that led to the creation of the $1.7 trillion, 4,155-page omnibus spending bill. He said on the House floor:I will make you this promise: this will be the last time Congress disgraces itself like this again.In 11 days the new House Republican majority takes over. And in 11 days this same old business as usual approach is over.Republicans will do what the Democrats have failed to do: We will pass legislation on time – and we will do it in an open and transparent manner.McCarthy also promised that he would not consider a bill that grants amnesty to illegal aliens or pass gun control if he becomes speaker in an interview with Breitbart News’s Matthew Boyle:Sean Moran is a policy reporter for Breitbart News.
