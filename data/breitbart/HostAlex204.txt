Host Alex Marlow begins today’s podcast with a breakdown of the Super Bowl, the halftime show, and the inevitable rioting in Philadelphia. How woke was it? Listen to find out. Then Alex gets into more UFOs being shot down by the U.S. and Canadian governments. What do we know? Not much. A train derailment has caused a chemical explosion, and the media seems almost entirely uninterested. Finally, Alex caps off the opening with an epic woke story. Our guest today is Congressman and Ret. Navy SEAL Derrick van Orden (R-WI). He shares all he knows about the UFOs and why he is increasingly concerned about the escalating tensions with China.The Breitbart News Daily Podcast runs Monday through Friday as a “Director’s Cut” of the SXM Patriot radio show.
