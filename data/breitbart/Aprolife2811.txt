A pro-life billboard located in Portland, Oregon was removed on Monday after vandals spray painted the words “kill them kids” across the sign and crossed out the eyes of the baby featured on it, KOIN reported. The billboard, which was located on the 1600 block of Sandy Boulevard, displayed an advertisement from the nonprofit group ProLife Across America and originally read “Protect the babies” and “heartbeat 18 days from conception.” The Portland Police Bureau told the outlet that it is unclear if any police reports have been filed in connection to the vandalism.  A pro-life billboard in Portland was vandalized with the message, “Kill them kids.” When Roe v Wade was overturned last year, a number of pregnancy resource centers in Portland (& elsewhere) were attacked.
