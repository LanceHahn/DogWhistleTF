Iran has publicly threatened artists who drew cartoons mocking the country’s supreme leader after they were published in French satire magazine Charlie Hebdo.Iran’s Foreign Minister took to social media on Wednesday to threaten those who drew cartoons mocking the country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, promising that a “firm response” from Tehran was forthcoming. Some solid action followed as the Iranian government shut down a French institute in Tehran as a punishment, Politico reports.The cartoons were published by the famed satirist magazine, Charlie Hebdo, after it ran a competition last month asking artists around the world to send in works mocking the Iranian leader in a show of support for ongoing protests for women’s rights in the country.Like many cartoons published before them by the magazine, the various images — which range from depicting a bunch of little Khameneis crawling into a naked woman’s vagina to a little girl setting the Islamist dictator’s beard on fire — have sparked serious anger amongst some in the Muslim world.Charlie Hebdo is well known — to put it mildly — for publishing cartoons and articles which make giving offence a work of art in itself, and so is broadly seen as being in the vanguard of defending freedom of speech. Past cartoons have insulted all world religions, notable political figures, royals, and the general public. Most of the magazine’s editorial staff were murdered by Islamist radicals in 2015.Numéro spécial du 7 janvier !
