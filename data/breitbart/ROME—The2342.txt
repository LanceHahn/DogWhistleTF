ROME — The indomitable Cardinal George Pell, Australia’s leading Catholic prelate for decades, died in Rome late Tuesday at the age of 81.Cardinal Pell had hip replacement surgery in Rome on Tuesday but went into cardiac arrest just hours later and died due to complications from the procedure.In 2014, Pope Francis appointed Cardinal Pell the first prefect of the Vatican’s Secretariat for the Economy, but his digging into illicit financial operations during his tenure made his presence uncomfortable and he was “progressively marginalized.”Pell’s investigations eventually culminated in the trial for “financial crimes” of the Vatican’s former no. 3 man, Cardinal Angelo Becciu, which is still ongoing.A fearless and cogent defender of Catholic orthodoxy, Cardinal Pell was falsely accused of sexual abuse and convicted in 2018. He served 404 days in prison, many of them in solitary confinement, before finally being “completely exonerated” of all charges in a unanimous judgment by the Australian High Court in April 2020.Australian Cardinal George Pell relaxing in his home at the Vatican, Thursday, May 20, 2021.
