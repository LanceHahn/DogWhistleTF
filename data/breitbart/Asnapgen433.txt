A snap general election would see Britain’s governing Conservative (Tory) Party sink to third place in Parliament and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and predecessors Liz Truss and Boris Johnson kicked out of parliament, polls suggest.While the Tories have placed first in the last four general elections, winning their biggest parliamentary majority since the 1980s under Boris Johnson in 2019, polling conducted by Find Out Now and Electoral Calculus for The Daily Telegraph suggests the British public’s patience has snapped, with Prime Minister Sunak — elevated to the country’s highest office with no mandate from the electorate or even his own party members — facing a crushing defeat and the loss of his own seat in the House of Commons.Liz Truss, who defeated Sunak in a leadership contest last year but was soon ousted and replaced with him by party politicians regardless, without regular party members being able to vote against him a second time, is also projected to lose her seat, along with Boris Johnson and 14 members of the Cabinet besides the Prime Minister himself.All told, the polling indicates that the Tories would collapse to just 45 seats — a loss of 320 — and sink to third place behind the left-separatist Scottish National Party (SNP), which with 50 Members of Parliament (MPs) would become the official Opposition in the House of Commons despite the fact that it does not even stand for elections outside Scotland.Our new large MRP poll with @FindoutnowUK for @Telegraph shows #Labour 25% ahead and the Conservatives set to get fewer seats than the SNP.
