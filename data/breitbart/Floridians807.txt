Floridians are spending millions of dollars supporting state university diversity and equity efforts, according to the self-reported responses to the DeSantis administration’s inquiry asking all state university and college systems to report expenditures used for any and all activities related to Critical Race Theory (CRT), diversity, equity, and inclusion.The DeSantis administration requested the information in December, requiring responses by January 13, 2023. It contended that it needed to have a “full understanding to the operational expenses of state institutions” specifically in regards to diversity, equity, inclusion, and CRT:MEMO: All state university & college systems in Florida have been required to report expenditures and resources utilized for campus activities related to diversity, equity, and inclusion and critical race theory.

Griffin added that the University of Central Florida’s Vice President for Diversity Equity and Inclusion and assistant “are paid a combined $445,000 at taxpayer expense, annually.”Griffin assured that the DeSantis administration is continuing to identify these efforts focusing on agenda rather than education — something DeSantis mentioned at a press conference this week.“If you look around the country — and Florida is not immune to this — there’s really a debate going on about what is the purpose of higher education, particularly publicly funded higher education systems,” he said.“And I think you have the dominant view, which I think is not the right view, but the dominant view is the use of higher education under this view is to impose ideological conformity to try to provoke political activism, and that’s what a university should be, that’s not what we believe is appropriate in the state of Florida,” he continued, explaining that his administration is working to “eliminate all the AI and CRT bureaucracies in the state of Florida.”“No funding and that will wither on the vine, and I think that that’s very important because it really serves as an ideological filter, a political filter,” he added.
