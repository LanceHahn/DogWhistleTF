Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) demanded “swift” accountability this weekend for the death of Keenan Anderson in a confrontation with police before the facts were known — including whether Anderson was trying to hijack cars.Anderson, a 31-year-0ld teacher from Washington, DC, who happens to be a cousin of Black Lives Matter founder Patrisse Cullors, died Jan. 3 after being tased during a confrontation with Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officers.The Los Angeles Times reported:The incident began Jan. 3 at 3:30 p.m. with a motorcycle officer arriving at what the LAPD characterized as a “felony hit-and-run” car crash at Venice and Lincoln boulevards. Police said Anderson was in the middle of the street, declaring, “Please help me.” LAPD Chief Michel Moore alleged this week that another driver reported that Anderson had attempted “to get into another car without his permission.”Anderson then wanders in and out of cars, with the officer telling him to get on the sidewalk, according to the video. The officer yells, “Get up against the wall.”…Moore said data from the Taser weapon showed “there were six separate activations over 42 seconds. The first two [were] in the probe mode. We believe the darts weren’t effective. Then four activations over 33 seconds” in the stun mode in which the pulse was applied directly to the skin.The LAPD released body camera footage of the encounter, which led to public condemnations by elected officials, and expressions of grief and outrage, including from Rep. Schiff.You tweeted out a deceptively edited video clip that removes crucial context around this tragic incident.

Crime has spiked in the city and the county since those riots.Joel B.
