Rapper Young Thug, whose real name is Jeffery Lamar Williams, has been accused by prosecutors of being party to a “hand-to-hand drug deal” with his co-defendant inside a Georgia courtroom.Video has been released which appears to illustrate the claim made against the Atlanta performer.The incident happened last Wednesday. The star is seen in the video seated next to his attorney when his co-defendant Khalieff Adams walks over and drops something into his hand in the dramatic court room surveillance footage obtained by WSB-TV.Prosecutors alleged in the motion filed in Georgia’s Fulton County Superior Court that Kahlieff Adams — a fellow defendant who is also serving a life sentence for a murder conviction — slipped a Percocet pill into Young Thug’s hands during jury selection.This booking photo provided by Fulton County Sheriff’s Office shows Atlanta rapper Young Thug,  whose name is Jeffery Lamar Williams, one of 28 people indicted Monday, May 9, 2022, in Georgia on conspiracy to violate the state’s RICO act and street gang charges, according to jail records.
