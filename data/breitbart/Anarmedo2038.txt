An armed officer with London’s Metropolitan Police has admitted to being a prolific serial rapist in court.David Carrick, an armed officer who served in the London Metropolitan Police’s parliamentary and diplomatic protection command, reportedly pleaded guilty to two dozen rapes over the span of two decades.The force has since apologised for the officer’s conduct, as well as the fact that there were signs that Carrick serially abused and sexually assaulted women during his time in the force.According to a report by the British state-owned broadcaster, the BBC, the 48-year-old was only finally suspended from duty in 2021 after one woman came forward to accuse him of rape.Upon the publication of his name in the media, 12 more women reportedly came forward alleging various instances of sexual abuse, including rape and false imprisonment.As of Monday, Carrick has now pleaded guilty to a total of 49 offences levelled against him, including a total of 24 instances of rape said to have taken place between 2003 and 2020.Reportedly nicknamed “Bastard Dave” by his colleagues for his “cruel” behaviour, the London police force was reportedly given numerous opportunities to figure out something was wrong over the last two decades, with multiple sexually-related complaints being filed against Carrick during his time in the force.We condemn the appalling criminal actions of serving police officer David Carrick.
