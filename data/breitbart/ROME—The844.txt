ROME — The head of the U.S. Bishops’ Conference (USCCB), Archbishop Timothy Broglio, has publicly corrected President Biden’s misrepresentation of the position of Church leaders on the matter of taxpayer-funded abortion.Last Tuesday, Mr. Biden denied reports that the U.S. bishops are “demanding that federal tax dollars not fund abortion,” adding that neither was Pope Francis doing so.In response, Archbishop Broglio released a statement asserting that the Bishops are united in opposing abortion as a grave evil and that Pope Francis himself has denounced abortion in the strongest possible terms.“As we are taught by Jesus, human life is sacred. God calls us to defend and nurture life from the moment a new human being is conceived,” the archbishop stated. “The Catholic Church has been clear and consistent in this teaching.”“The Catholic bishops of the United States are united in our commitment to life and will continue to work as one body in Christ to make abortion unthinkable,” he declared.Broglio went on to cite Pope Francis, who has compared recourse to abortion to hiring a hitman. “It is not right to ‘do away with’ a human being, however small, in order to solve a problem,” the pope has said.President Joe Biden speaks about abortion access during a Democratic National Committee event at the Howard Theatre, Tuesday, Oct. 18, 2022, in Washington.
