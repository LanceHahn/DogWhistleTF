Troy University in Troy, Alabama, is offering a business school program that trains students to combat woke capitalism in the workplace. The new program has received rave reviews for including lectures on topics such as how DEI programs divide Americans.The Free Enterprise Scholars program, which finished its first semester this past fall, has already proven itself popular among students, the Dean of the Sorrell College of Business at Troy University says.President Joe Biden’s administration ceased all oil and gas leases to Alaska’s Cook Inlet and the Gulf of Mexico as of the night of Wednesday, May 11.
