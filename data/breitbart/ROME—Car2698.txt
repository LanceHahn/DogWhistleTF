ROME — Cardinal Joseph Zen attended the funeral of Pope Benedict XVI in the Vatican Thursday after Hong Kong authorities granted him leave to travel to Rome for five days.Police arrested the 90-year-old cardinal last year under the territory’s notorious national security law and confiscated his passport to keep him from leaving the country, which they temporarily restored to him.The former bishop of Hong Kong arrived in St. Peter’s Square wearing red Mass vestments and walking with a cane to concelebrate the funeral Mass of Pope Benedict, who had made him a cardinal in 2006.Zen was one of some 130 cardinals who concelebrated the funeral Mass together with Pope Francis, including U.S. Cardinals Daniel DiNardo and Timothy Dolan, along with another 400 bishops and 4,000 priests.Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Italian President Sergio Mattarella, Elke Budenbender and husband German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier watch as the coffin of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI is carried away by pallbearers after the funeral mass at St. Peter’s square on January 5, 2023 in Vatican City, Vatican.
