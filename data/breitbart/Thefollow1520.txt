The following article by Ron Paul is sponsored content by Birch Gold.If you are nearing your retirement age, all of the hard-earned money you have put away for your future could now be in danger.Why? Because the worst financial disaster in history is unfolding before our eyes. Call it the “everything bubble.” Call it the “death of the dollar.” Call it whatever you want. Most Americans are struggling to make ends meet because of what’s happening.And the elites know things are only going to get worse. For example, the UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres recently said, “We are looking into the eye of a Category 5 hurricane. Our world is plagued by a perfect storm on a number of fronts.”Meanwhile, the government thinks the solution is more taxes and more money printing. And don’t forget, the far-left Democrat in the White House has targeted retirees multiple times with increased taxes.Clearly this situation cannot continue! But here’s the crucial question: do you really believe Biden won’t be able to indirectly get your retirement savings? By continuing to print dollars and eventually driving America into hyperinflation?If this happens, it would be disastrous for everyone with a stock and dollar-based retirement account.But the good news is you are not powerless. There is one strategy that can protect your retirement savings from stock crashes, inflation, and Biden.It’s a powerful gold-based retirement strategy that tens of thousands of Americans have used this year.
