Republican officials slammed President Joe Biden’s “legacy” ahead of his State of the Union address, pointing to the multiple crises affecting the nation as a result of the Democrat leader’s abundant “failures,” while calling to “reverse course.”As lawmakers gather for the Tuesday night address, the 80-year-old president is preparing to showcase his efforts to rebuild the country’s economy, set the stage for his bid for a 2024 re-election, and likely demand Congress approve an amnesty for the nation’s 11 to 22 million illegal aliens.Meanwhile, GOP members tore into the president’s legacy, highlighting the current unenthusiastic state of the nation.Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) insisted Americans “will not forget the multiple crises Joe Biden created,” listing crime, border, inflation, national security and energy crises among them.“Biden’s failures will be on FULL display!” she declared.During tomorrow’s #SOTU address, Americans will not forget the multiple crises Joe Biden created:– Crime Crisis– Border Crisis– Inflation Crisis– National Security Crisis– Energy CrisisBiden’s failures will be on FULL display!— Elise Stefanik (@EliseStefanik) February 6, 2023Biden “must answer for the cost of his failed Far Left agenda on hardworking families, his weakness on the world stage, and reckless government spending,” she added in another tweet.Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) pointed to the “inconvenient truths” of higher inflation, mortgage rates, credit card interest rates, and food prices.“The rich are getting richer while middle class Americans suffer,” he wrote.You’ll hear a lot of nice talking points from @JoeBiden at the #SOTU tomorrow, but here’s some inconvenient truths:Inflation ⬆️Mortgage rates ⬆️Credit card interest rates ⬆️ Food prices ⬆️The rich are getting richer while middle class Americans suffer. pic.twitter.com/sGVk74ZU8t— Rick Scott (@ScottforFlorida) February 6, 2023“Crushing inflation, a border crisis, and weakness on China—that’s President Biden’s legacy after two years,” wrote Sen.
