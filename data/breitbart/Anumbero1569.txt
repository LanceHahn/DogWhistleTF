A number of politicians within the progressive Scottish National Party have come under fire after reportedly being pictured by a sign calling for trans-critical “terfs” to be beheaded.A number of MPs and one MSP within the ruling Scottish National Party (SNP) have been roundly criticised after images emerged of them at a protest standing beside a sign calling for individuals critical of transgenderism — sometimes known by the neologism “terf” — to be beheaded.The pictures were reportedly taken at a demonstration protesting the UK government’s decision to block a law that would allow children aged sixteen years and over to legally declare their own gender without medical supervision which was recently passed by the Scottish parliament.According to a report by The Telegraph, MPs for the SNP Alison Thewliss, Kirsten Oswald and Stewart McDonald were all pictured standing near the handmade sign, which read “decapitate terfs” alongside images of heats and a guillotine.The representatives have reportedly claimed that, despite the allegedly accurate images, they were unaware of the sign at the demonstration.A few of Scotland's wonderfully progressive and kind politicians, posing proudly in front of banners calling for women to be decapitated and eaten. pic.twitter.com/satQhRojbA— J.K.

Rowling posting a picture of Stewart near the sign with the caption “I too beam with delight when having my photograph taken with things of which I am entirely unaware”.J.K.
