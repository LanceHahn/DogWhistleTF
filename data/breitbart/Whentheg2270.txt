When the globalist elites fly into Davos, Switzerland, in coming days to prepare for the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting, they will be far from alone as they step off their private jet transports and into the fleet of waiting limousines.Up to 5,000 soldiers from the Swiss army are mobilised to welcome attendees to the luxury ski resort and protect participants from any harassment, protests or dissenting voices should the need arise.In a statement released Friday, January 6th, the Swiss Defense Department (VBS) said the Federal Assembly, the country’s parliament, had approved the deployment of the mass Swiss army contingent, the Swiss German-language newspaper Blick reports.Anti-WEF protests are reportedly expected to take place all next week after the conference opening on Monday.File/A sniper stands on the roof of the Kongress Hotel next to the Congress Center during the World Economic Forum annual meeting on January 26, 2011 in Davos.
