He later loaned Zelensky one of his Oscars until Ukraine wins its war with Russia.Zelensky recently appeared before Congress where he was welcomed like a hero, with then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) comparing him to Winston Churchill.A Breitbart News analysis found that  that the more than $110 billion in aid that Congress has approved to send to Ukraine could have built a complete wall along the entirety of the U.S.-Mexico border, multiple times over.The 80th Golden Globe Awards will air live on NBC Tuesday starting at 8 p.m. ET.Follow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg.
