Prince Harry has branded his stepmother, Queen Consort Camilla, a “dangerous” person due to her “villain” status.Speaking in a recent interview, the wayward prince attacked the Queen Consort, saying in particular that her closeness with the British media made her “dangerous”.It is one of the many damaging claims made by the woke prince, who has been engaging in open warfare with his largely silent family over the last number of months.Speaking to American broadcaster CBS, Harry claimed that both he and Prince William — the current heir to the British throne — were against their father, now King Charles III, marrying Camilla.In his new book, Prince Harry accuses Camilla and even his father, at times, of using him or William to get better tabloid coverage for themselves.
