UK coronavirus lockdown critics and sceptics were placed under government surveillance using the opaque resources of the country’s military, a report Sunday alleges.The Mail on Sunday reports military operatives in the UK’s “information warfare” 77 Brigade drove the operation that targeted politicians and high-profile journalists who raised public doubts about the official pandemic response through their social media activities.The report claims those being watched included public figures such as ex-Conservative Minister and army veteran David Davis, who questioned the modelling behind alarming death toll predictions, as well as journalists such as Peter Hitchens and Toby Young.They were just three of the public figures who numbered amongst the tens of thousands who protested against the UK government’s lockdown policies.Covid-19 sceptics hold placards as they gather for a ‘Unite For Freedom’ rally against Covid-19 vaccinations and government lockdown restrictions, in Parliament Square, central London on May 29, 2021.

These posts did not contain information that was untrue or co-ordinated – it was simply fear.”Delingpole: Lockdowns Were Inspired by the CCP, admits Professor Pantsdown https://t.co/1Bdz6J5HOa— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 27, 2020Former Cabinet Minister Davis, a member of the Privy Council, told the outlet: “It’s outrageous that people questioning the Government’s policies were subject to covert surveillance” – and questioned the waste of public money.Veteran journalist Hitchens questioned if he was “shadow-banned” on social media over his criticisms, with his views effectively censored by being pushed down in online search results.He says the “most astonishing thing about the great Covid panic was how many attacks the state managed to make on basic freedoms without anyone much even caring, let alone protesting. ”Lockdown Sceptic MP Slams ‘Crazed Scientists’ Who Have ‘Socialist Wet Dream’ of Locking Down Britons Again https://t.co/ClidiAhwtg— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 7, 2021A Downing Street source responded by saying the units from 77 Brigade – which uses both regular and reserve troops – had scaled back their work significantly since the end of the lockdowns.Read The Mail on Sunday report in full here.
