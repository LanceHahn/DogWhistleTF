Congresswoman Lauren Boebert (R-CO) introduced a bill that would defund Planned Parenthood and redirect funding to community health centers that do not perform abortions.Boebert introduced the Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2023 on Friday with the support of 29 House Republican co-sponsors, Fox News reported. The legislation would place a one-year moratorium on federal funds allotted to Planned Parenthood unless the abortion giant guarantees that no funding would be used to perform or assist in performing abortions at any of its clinics and affiliates, the bill reads.“The nation’s largest abortion provider has no business receiving taxpayer dollars. Planned Parenthood claims these funds go to healthcare for women, but last year, Planned Parenthood performed a record number of abortions while also reducing the number of well-woman exams and breast cancer screenings it performed,” Boebert said.U.S. Congresswoman Lauren Boebert speaking with attendees at the 2021 Young Women’s Leadership Summit hosted by Turning Point USA at the Gaylord Texan Resort & Convention Center in Grapevine, Texas.
