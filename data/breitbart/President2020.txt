Martin Luther King III’s wife’s name is Arndrea Waters King.“Well look, my wife has a rule in our family, when it’s somebody’s birthday you sing happy birthday, you ready?” Biden asked before launching into the song Happy Birthday.Joe Biden decided to sing happy birthday to MLK III’s wife and clearly forgets her name. This is straight out of “The Office.” Amazing: pic.twitter.com/V1TAfNLgFn— Clay Travis (@ClayTravis) January 16, 2023Biden sang into the microphone, but when it came time to mention the name of the woman’s birthday, he muttered “Valle” in the microphone instead of Arndrea.He did not apologize or correct his blunder, but kept singing until the song was over.Biden also joked about King’s age.“Well, it’s hell turning 30, but you gotta put up with it,” he concluded.
