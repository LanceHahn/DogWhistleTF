Security researchers were able to gain “super administrative access” to Reviver, the sole provider of California’s digital license plates, and track the GPS location of all of vehicles they are associated with.A team of security researchers successfully obtained “full super administrative access,” which allowed them to perform a slew of tasks involving the company’s user accounts and vehicles, according to a blog post by researcher Sam Curry.A motorcyclist drives between cars, trucks, and sport utility vehicles (SUVs) on the 405 Freeway during rush hour traffic as oil and gasoline fuel prices experienced an increase on March 10, 2022 in Los Angeles, California.

Our investigation confirmed that this potential vulnerability has not been misused.”“Customer information has not been affected, and there is no evidence of ongoing risk related to this report,” the company continued. “As part of our commitment to data security and privacy, we also used this opportunity to identify and implement additional safeguards to supplement our existing, significant protections.”“Cybersecurity is central to our mission to modernize the driving experience and we will continue to work with industry-leading professionals, tools, and systems to build and monitor our secure platforms for connected vehicles,” Reviver added.You can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Facebook and Twitter at @ARmastrangelo, and on Instagram.
