Former President Donald Trump warned Republicans not to vote for any cuts to social security or medicare as lawmakers spar over the debt ceiling.“Under no circumstances should Republicans vote to cut a single penny from medicare or social security to help pay for Joe Biden’s reckless spending spree, which is more reckless than anybody’s ever done or had in the history of our country,” Trump began at the start of his latest campaign video, released Friday.He emphasized that Biden and the Democrats have “wasted trillions on left-wing lunacy” and that they have “thrown open our treasury and our borders to migrants from all over the world.”“While we absolutely need to stop Biden’s out-of-control spending, the pain should be borne by Washington bureaucrats, not by hardworking American families and American seniors,” said the 45th president, adding that seniors have been “absolutely destroyed in the last two years.”Last week, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen penned a letter to House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) predicting that the $31.3 trillion debt ceiling would be reached on January 19. On Thursday, she informed McCarthy that it had been reached. To keep the United States from defaulting on its exorbitant debt, Yellen said that she would begin to use “extraordinary measures.”House Speaker Kevin McCarthy of Calif., speaks with members of the press before attending a House Republican Steering Committee meeting on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, Jan. 11, 2023.

Save social security, don’t destroy it,” he warned.
