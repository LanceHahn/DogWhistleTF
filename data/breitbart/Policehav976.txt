Police have arrested one individual after a car is said to have driven through an anti-mass migration protest in Ireland on Tuesday.Police in Ireland have confirmed the arrest of one man after an incident involving a car driving through an anti-mass migration protest in the country’s capital, Dublin, on Tuesday.The EU nation has seen a sudden surge in protests over the last number of weeks amid attempts by the government to house more and more migrants in local areas, with authorities now frequently having to resort to putting some of the tens of thousands arriving in the country into disused office blocks and other facilities as the migrant crisis worsens.The figures involved, particularly amid the recent survey of Ukrainian refugees, is considerable given the population of Ireland is just five million.At one of these protests, which is said to have taken place in the Dublin 5 region of the capital on Tuesday, a car is said to have driven at speed through the demonstrations, prompting shock and alarm from the crowd.Warning: Strong Language:
