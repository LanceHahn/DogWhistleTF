Host Alex Marlow opens today’s podcast with a breakdown of the chaotic Speaker of the House race. As Alex semi-predicted yesterday, Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) did not get the votes necessary to win the Speakership. Alex breaks down the how and the why. It might take a while to resolve the race now. In the meantime, there will be no investigations, which is bad, but no more crappy bills that waste your money, which is good. It’s all exciting, and very, very messy. Our guest today is Darren Beattie, a journalist for Revolver News. He has done some heavy lifting covering the Deep State and the January 6 lies. He also has some compelling  potential solutions to some of the deepest problems facing the country.The Breitbart News Daily Podcast runs Monday through Friday as a “Director’s Cut” of the SXM Patriot radio show. Hosted by Breitbart Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow, you’ll hear Alex’s take on the big political stories, interviews with various newsmakers, and the Patriot “Caller of the Day.”SUBSCRIBE for free by clicking your preferred podcast platform below.
