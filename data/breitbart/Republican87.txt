Republican officials slammed President Joe Biden and his “socialist agenda” while accusing him of “gaslighting Americans” over the acceleration of U.S. inflation in January despite efforts by the Federal Reserve to tame price hikes with higher interest rates.On Tuesday, the Labor Department announced a 0.5 percent rise in January in the consumer price index — which measures what consumers pay for goods and services — compared with a month earlier. The rise was higher than expected, signaling persistent inflation, even as the president insists record-high prices are ending.In response, GOP members slammed the president for the spike in prices, pointing to his radical agenda.“The most expensive Valentine’s Day ever,” wrote House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA).The most expensive Valentine's Day ever pic.twitter.com/ApiCGXoGqu— Kevin McCarthy (@SpeakerMcCarthy) February 14, 2023“Joe Biden is continuing his premature victory lap on the economy despite today’s CPI report showing inflation surged last month,” wrote House Majority Whip Tom Emmer.“But that gaslighting doesn’t work on anyone who’s had to go to the grocery store, put gas in their car, or pay their utility bills lately,” he added.Joe Biden is continuing his premature victory lap on the economy despite today's CPI report showing inflation surged last month.But that gaslighting doesn't work on anyone who's had to go to the grocery store, put gas in their car, or pay their utility bills lately.— Tom Emmer (@GOPMajorityWhip) February 14, 2023“Not surprisingly, Biden’s plan to spend our way out of inflation has been a massive failure,” wrote Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas).Not surprisingly, Biden's plan to spend our way out of inflation has been a massive failure.— Tom Cotton (@TomCottonAR) February 14, 2023“Biden may have stopped caring.

Ken Buck (@RepKenBuck) February 15, 2023Over the last 12 months, the consumer price index is up 6.4 percent, down from 6.5 percent in December and 7.1 percent in November.Economists had forecast the index rising 0.4 percent for the month and 6.2 percent from a year ago, according to Econoday.However, on Tuesday, White House Council of Economic Advisers Chair Cecilia Rouse claimed the January CPI report shows “an economy where we see inflation continuing to ease with a labor market that remains robust” because the month-to-month increases “were at expectations.”“We’re making the progress we need to see in order to achieve the softish landing where inflation comes down and the labor market remains robust,” she added.Follow Joshua Klein on Twitter @JoshuaKlein.
