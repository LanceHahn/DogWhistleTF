House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik (R-NY) told Breitbart News the first select committee hearing to uproot political weaponization within the federal government against political opponents will occur Thursday and lay the groundwork for future hearings.Stefanik, who was appointed to the “Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government,” along with other notable members, said the event will set the stage for House Republicans to unearth, expose, and terminate political bias within the federal government often directed towards conservatives or American First Americans.“This first hearing will be critical to laying the groundwork to uproot the longstanding political weaponization against the American people entrenched in the federal government,” she said.Stefanik pledged the select committee, chaired by House Judiciary Committee Chair Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), will particularly fight partisanship with the FBI, CIA, and NIH, along with corruption and abuse across all facets of the entrenched federal bureaucracy.“The FBI’s partisan censorship violating First Amendment rights and civil liberties and full weaponization against the American people will be exposed as the Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government hits the ground running this week,” she said.Republican Conference Chairman Rep.

In January, McGonigal was indicted by the Justice Department for money laundering and “agreeing to provide services” to Oleg Deripaska, a sanctioned Russian oligarch.“These agencies are ripe for transparency and ultimately reforms, and this select committee is going to be one of the many tools we have in the majority to get to the truth and make sure the American people know the truth,” Stefanik noted.Follow Wendell Husebø on Twitter @WendellHusebø.
