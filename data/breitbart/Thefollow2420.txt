The following is sponsored content by Stansberry Research.Bill Bonner went to law school with Fed Chair Jerome Powell.He has co-authored three New York Times bestsellers.And he is one of the most successful entrepreneurs in America today, with more than 1,000 employees in roughly a dozen countries.We’re telling you about Bonner today because he’s made three big, macro-economic predictions in his career… each of which ultimately came true, though Bonner was mocked each time.And today, Bill Bonner has issued what he calls his “4th and Final Warning.”If Bonner is right yet again, 2023 will be a year of massive change in our country.Bonner’s first big call was back in the 1980s, when he warned folks of the imminent Japanese stock crash.His second big warning concerned the “dot.com” internet companies of the late 1990s.Bonner’s third warning dealt with the massive bubble in mortgage finance and real estate. Ultimately, all three of Bonner’s big predictions came true.And that brings us to today.“My other big warnings to date really only affected investors (and homeowners, in the case of the mortgage crisis),” Bonner says.“The looming crisis I want to tell you about today, however, will affect everyone. And in ways that will be difficult for you to avoid.”If Bonner is right this time too (and early evidence looks that way), it will impact not only your investments and savings, but so many other aspects of your daily life.In short, 2023 could be a year unlike anything we’ve seen in a long time in America.We strongly encourage you to take a few minutes to hear Bill Bonner’s “4th and Final Warning.” You won’t find this information anywhere else.In this segment, Bonner also outlines 4 Important Steps he thinks every American should take right nowWe’ve posted the full prediction on our website, free of charge. Click here to view.
