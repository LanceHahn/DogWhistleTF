Oklahoma state Treasurer Todd Russ sent a letter, first seen by Breitbart News, to numerous national financial institutions, including fund managers and banks, demanding answers to a questionnaire asking who is “boycott[ing] energy companies” in Oklahoma and should be placed on a blacklist.The companies will have 60 days to respond, which is the first step Russ is taking to compile the list of companies Oklahoma government entities will be prohibited from doing business with because of their leftist environmental, social, and governance (ESG) policies.“I took office on January 9th and began compiling a list of companies, banks, and other entities that act against Oklahoma’s interests because of their ESG stance. It is my responsibility to ensure Oklahoman’s tax dollars will not be used to enrich organizations that act counter to our taxpayers’ interests and our values,” Russ said in a statement to Breitbart News.The letter was sent to institutions like BlackRock, JP Morgan, StateStreet, Vanguard, and other companies to determine if the financial institutions “boycott energy companies.” This would ultimately place the company on a public list that would “prohibit Oklahoma governmental entities from investing in, and may potentially require divestment from [the] company, [the] company’s affiliates, and subsidiaries, or investment vehicles affiliated with [the] company, its affiliates or subsidiaries.”“This questionnaire provides an opportunity for financial companies to attest to their business actions as they relate to Oklahoma. Other states are taking similar steps, and Oklahoma joins them in asserting that we will not do business with financial companies who discriminate against or boycott our energy industries and businesses,” Russ continued.Oklahoma State Treasurer Todd Russ holds his hand over his heart as the national anthem is played during inauguration ceremonies Monday, Jan. 9, 2023, in Oklahoma City.

Last November, multiple state treasurers attended SFOF’s conference to present strategies to combat the ESG policy movement. And with one of the main focuses on educating Americans on the dangers of ESG policies, the group launched a website and a video explainer. Multiple state treasurers at the conference also explained to Breitbart News that ESG policies hurt each state differently but collectively hurt all American taxpayers financially.Their joint aim remains to combat left-wing policies masquerading as economics.File/Oklahoma state Rep.

Companies like BlackRock are on notice – this is what happens when you wage war on the pocketbooks of the American people for the sake of a radical progressive agenda and your friends in the Chinese Communist Party. You lose.”Jacob Bliss is a reporter for Breitbart News. Write to him at jbliss@breitbart.com or follow him on Twitter @JacobMBliss.
