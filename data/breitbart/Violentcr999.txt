Violent criminals and rapists who identify was transwomen are indeed women, Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said.Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s leftist first minister, told journalists that rapists and violent criminals who claim to be “transgender” women are indeed actual women during an interview.It comes after her Justice Secretary, Keith Brown, made a similar claim, arguing that anyone who claimed to be a woman — even if they were a violent sexual criminal — needed to be taken at “face value“, though this did not mean that they should be permitted to enter female prisons.Speaking to UK broadcaster ITV later that day, Sturgeon doubled down on Brown’s stated position, affirming that such criminals are women despite the regional government now wanting to prevent them from being moved to women’s prisons.Does Scotland’s First Minister believe all trans women are women?
