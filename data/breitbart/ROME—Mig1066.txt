ROME — Migrants leaving Africa to travel across the Mediterranean Sea to Europe are only looking for “a little well-being,” Pope Francis said Tuesday.The pope left Rome Tuesday morning on a flight for the Democratic Republic of Congo during which he exchanged a few words with the more than 70 journalists aboard the papal plane to cover the journey.“Right now we are crossing the Sahara,” the pontiff told the reporters. “Let us offer a thought, in silence, a prayer for all the people who are looking for a little well-being, a little freedom, have crossed it and have not made it.”“So many suffering people who arrive at the Mediterranean and after crossing the desert are taken to the concentration camps and suffer there,” the pontiff continued. “Let us pray for all those people.”The pope was referring to Libyan migrant detention centers, which Francis has often compared to “concentration camps.”In October 2021, for example, Francis said hears the cries of migrants in Libya and appealed for streamlined migration routes as an alternative to repatriation.File/Pope Francis poses for photographs during a meeting with a group of migrants at his weekly audience in St. Peter’s square at the Vatican for on on June 6, 2018.
