ROME — The Burmese army torched a historic Catholic church in the Archdiocese of Mandalay this week and also set fire to a convent of religious sisters.Soldiers burned to the ground the ancient Church of the Assumption, in Chan Thar, a village inhabited by Catholics in the Sagaing region, as well as the nearby convent of the Franciscan Missionary Sisters of Mary, Vatican News reported.The nuns fled from their demolished convent along with some 3,000 villagers, who also lost their homes to fires started by the military.On Sunday, Pope Francis expressed his grief over the attack, noting that the Church of Our Lady of the Assumption was “one of the oldest and most important places of worship in the country,” having been built in 1894.“I am close to the defenseless civilian population, which is sorely tried in many cities,” the pontiff said following his weekly Angelus address. “May God grant that this conflict may soon end and a new time of forgiveness, love and peace may follow.”File/A protester holds a sign demanding H&M withdraws from Myanmar, outside H&M in Oxford Street on June 11, 2022 in London, England.

From there, they carry out raids from house to house to flush out the rebels.”“They stayed in our church for three days and when they left they set fire to the church and our convent,” she added.Follow @tdwilliamsrome
