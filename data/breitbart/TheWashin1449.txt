The Washington Post laid off 20 of its newsroom staffers and discontinued its gaming section and KidsPost, their news and features section aimed at children, the outlet announced on Tuesday.“While such changes are not easy, evolution is necessary for us to stay competitive, and the economic climate has guided our decision to act now,” Washington Post executive editor Sally Buzbee wrote in a note to staff. “We believe these steps will ultimately help us to fulfill our mission to scrutinize power and empower readers.”Buzbee added that the company is “not planning further job eliminations at this time.”The layoffs come after Post publisher Fred Ryan outraged staffers last month when he announced that a “number of positions” would be terminated at the beginning of 2023.The Washington Post via Getty Images Executive Editor, Sally Buzbee, speaks after the paper was awarded the 2022 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service as employees gather in the newsroom to watch the presentations on May 09, 2022, in Washington, DC.
