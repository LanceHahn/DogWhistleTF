I truly love the man because he gave up so much. He did a lot for Iowa, he did a lot for Iowa farmers, he did a lot for Americans,” said Lake, who grew up in Iowa before her news career took her to the Grand Canyon State.She continued:I want him back in because I think there’s only one person who can take this mess that Joe Biden has gotten our country into, where we’re teetering on, who knows what, World War III, a collapse of our economy, who knows what’s possible. There’s only one man I know who can get in there immediately and turn this around and that is President Donald J. Trump.  OMGosh!! This crowd in Iowa is twice as big as we were expecting. Team is moving furniture to make sure we can fit everyone inside. Don’t go anywhere, folks. We are making room! pic.twitter.com/vb5GzHNBLM— Kari Lake (@KariLake) February 10, 2023Lake received Trump’s endorsement in Arizona’s 2022 Republican gubernatorial primary, in which she earned the nomination.
