• Destroy the whole firearm;
• Convert the short-barreled rifle into a long-barreled rifle;
• Apply to register the weapon under the NFA; or
• Permanently remove and dispose of, or alter, the “stabilizing brace” from the firearm so that it cannot be reattached.Breitbart News noted the ATF pistol brace rule portends the registration of millions of firearms.GOA, GOF, and Texas AG Paxton are filing suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas on Thursday.Use the link below to help GOA and our Congressional 2A Champions fight the ATF ⤵️https://t.co/hUdMB7aWvg— Gun Owners of America (@GunOwners) February 9, 2023GOA’s senior vice president, Erich Pratt, commented on the suit, saying, “Millions of Americans are facing a very tight deadline to destroy or register their lawfully owned property under this draconian new rule. We hope the court will hear the pleas of gun owners across the country who will be irrevocably harmed by this rule, and GOA stands ready to fight it at every turn.”GOF’s Sam Paredes noted, “This rule will have some of the most wide-reaching impacts nationwide in the tyrannical history of gun control. We the People will not tolerate this abuse.”(GEORGE FREY/AFP via Getty Images)Paxton said, “This is yet another attempt by the Biden Administration to create a workaround to the U.S. Constitution and expand gun registration in America. There is absolutely no legal basis for ATF’s haphazard decision to try to change the long-standing classification for stabilizing braces, force registration on Americans, and then throw them in jail for ten years if they don’t quickly comply. This rule is dangerous and unconstitutional, and I’m hopeful that this lawsuit will ensure that it is never allowed to take effect.”AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.
