The Justice Department (DOJ) informed House Judiciary Committee Republicans on Monday that it could not fulfill all of their requests relating to the investigation into President Joe Biden’s handling of classified documents, citing the department’s “longstanding policy” about ongoing matters.The department told Judiciary Committee chair Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) and Rep. Mike Johnson (R-LA) that it would instead, per its cited policy, “maintain the confidentiality” of the open investigation, according to a letter written by Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legislative Affairs Carlos Uriarte and obtained by Breitbart News.The DOJ’s letter comes in response to Jordan and Johnson requesting on January 13 various documents and communications from the department relating to documents with classified markings found at the Penn Biden Center and Biden’s home in Wilmington, Delaware, dating back to Biden’s time as vice president and as a senator.“It is unclear when the Department first came to learn about the existence of these documents, and whether it actively concealed this information from the public on the eve of the 2022 elections,” Jordan and Johnson wroteThe DOJ’s actions with Biden also “appear to depart from how it acted” in a similar circumstance involving former President Donald Trump’s handling of classified documents, the congressmen added.DOJ has assigned special counsels to both cases, though they have notable differences. Trump’s back-and-forth with the government, for instance, went on for well over a year. DOJ also ultimately executed a warrant to search Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence and later released a now-viral photo of some of the documents sprawled on the floor, moves that Republicans contend were gratuitous.This image contained in a court filing by the Department of Justice on August 30, 2022, shows documents seized at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.
