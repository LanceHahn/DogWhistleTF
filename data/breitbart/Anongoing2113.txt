An ongoing protest attended by Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg against the expansion of a German coal mine has once again descended into violent clashes between demonstrators and police.On Friday, teenage activist Greta Thunberg arrived in the German village of Luetzerath, which is set to be demolished in order to make way for the expansion of the Garzweiler coal mine, which is seen as critical to ensuring the country’s energy security as the standoff between Russia and the West over the war in Ukraine has seen the economic powerhouse of Europe scramble to marshal coal supplies to replace the energy typically provided by gas purchased from Moscow.“You are change, you are hope.” Thunberg told the crowd of climate activists on Saturday, according to the Der Spiegel newspaper.“We are still here, Lützerath is still there,” she said, claiming that the fight is not over as long as the coal remains in the ground, adding: “We won’t give up.”A post shared by Greta Thunberg (@gretathunberg)According to police, the protest, which began earlier this week, has swelled to between 8,000 to 10,000 people.In order to prevent the numbers from growing further, officers erected a double fence around the area, which Der Spiegel noted has been used to stop anyone from coming or going, including journalists.Following the speech from Thunberg, violent clashes between the police and protestors were seen, with activists launching fireworks at the riot gear-clad officers and the police in turn chasing down and beating people with their batons.

In an operation launched earlier this week, hundreds of police have been working to remove activists, who have already occupied the hamlet of Luetzerath in western Germany.
