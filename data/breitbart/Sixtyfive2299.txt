Are you paying attention yet?— Congressman Troy Nehls (@RepTroyNehls) January 10, 2023The new committee will be chaired by Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-WI), a foreign policy hawk, and is set to hold public hearings to ultimately “investigate and submit policy recommendations” on China’s economic, technological, and security progress in addition to its competition with the United States.House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), during his remarks, urged members to vote to approve the creation of the committee and insisted that it would not be partisan. He said the committee would address bipartisan issues, such as the Chinese coronavirus, the economy, securing intellectual property, and bringing jobs back from China.“You have my word and my commitment. This is not a partisan committee. This will be a bipartisan committee that is my hope, my desire, to speak with one voice on the challenges that we have,” McCarthy said. “It would look at all aspects, from economics to COVID, and when we fell into COVID, not knowing whether we could have medical supplies because China controlled so much.”The complete list of Democrats who voted against establishing the committee are:Jacob Bliss is a reporter for Breitbart News.
