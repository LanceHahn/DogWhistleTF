Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), who rode into Congress as a populist “progressive,” has declared herself a card carrying member of the establishment, as she now runs interference for Hunter Biden — probably the most distinguished enemy of the working-class in American politics.In true theatre kid form, the same person who spent her career lamenting about how she was “born in a place where your ZIP code determines your destiny,” and the evils of “lobbyists’ money,” is now serving the quintessential “my dad’s a lawyer” dirtbag who used his last name to exploit tax payers and sell their national interest to the highest bidder.During the first House Oversight Committee hearing Wednesday on the censorship of the “laptop from hell” reporting by the New York Post, ahead of the 2020 election — a historic and unprecedented censorship conspiracy that she called a “hiccup” — AOC said reporting on Hunter’s malfeasance was “a right-wing political operation.”“We could be talking about health care, we could be talking about bringing down the cost of prescription drugs, we can be talking about abortion rights, civil rights, voting rights. But instead we’re talking about Hunter Biden’s half fake laptop story,” Ocasio-Cortez said.U.S. Rep.
