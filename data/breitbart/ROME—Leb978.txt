ROME — Lebanon is the target of “a systematic and calculated strategy by Iran and its minions to empty the country of its Christians,” Habib C. Malik told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview Wednesday.Malik, Senior Fellow on Lebanon and Middle Eastern Christians at The Philos Project, said Iran and its “proxies” are intentionally creating the conditions (poverty, collapse, instability, fear, despair) that are forcing Lebanon’s Christians to emigrate.“The principal Iranian proxy now dominating Lebanon is Hezbollah, the armed Lebanese Shiite group beholden firstly to the Iranian ideological and expansionist agenda, and not to Lebanon,” Malik told Breitbart News.Lebanon today “is facing a new and unprecedented threat unlike previous scourges — it is the difference between what I would term the ‘dumb evil’ of the Islamic State (ISIS or Daesh) and the ‘cunning evil’ of Hezbollah and its Iranian Mullah overlords,” he declared.Hezbollah “has done everything in its power first to precipitate Lebanon’s downfall and then, by protecting the criminal mafia ruling class responsible for the downfall, to prevent any measures from being taken to commence Lebanon’s recovery,” he contended.The intentional sabotage of sectors such as education, healthcare, and the banking system have given rise to a “galloping” emigration of predominantly Christian youth, Malik said, aggravated by Hezbollah terror strikes that have killed, injured, and displaced hundreds of thousands of Christians.Revelers gather to attend the ceremony of the lighting of the Christmas tree in Sassine Square in the Ashrafieh district of Lebanon’s capital Beirut on December 7, 2022.
