Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich said this week that an uncanny parallel can be drawn between the scandal-ridden Biden family and the fictional HBO series The Sopranos.“Between Hunter Biden’s laptop scandal, and the Bidens’ various shady private-equity schemes with foreign fraudsters, it’s not too hard to make the analogy,” Gingrich wrote.The Biden family is “an influence peddling center of corruption worthy of HBO fantasy,” Gingrich noted, but unfortunately for America, “it isn’t fiction.”Like Tony Soprano, President Joe Biden is clearly the “head of a family,” Gingrich observed, who has “repeatedly exploited his public offices to make money.”Similarly, his son Hunter Biden is like “the ambitious-but-dull son who wants to inherit the family business but always screws up,” he added.Melissa Cohen walks with her husband Hunter Biden and their son Beau Biden on the South Lawn of the White House as they arrive in Washington with President Joe Biden, Sunday, Dec. 4, 2022.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken “was the manager of the Penn Biden Center” and several other Biden team members “were paid by the University of Pennsylvania in the period between Joe Biden’s vice presidency and presidency,” Gingrich noted.In an apparent quid pro quo, Joe Biden “appointed former University President Amy Gutmann to be U.S. Ambassador to Germany” and named David Cohen, the former chairman of the Penn’s board of trustees, as U.S. Ambassador to Canada, Gingrich added.Meanwhile, the traditional news media is still bending over backwards to protect the Bidens, he asserted, and spent months “pretending that the laptop fiasco was Russian propaganda.”The elite legacy media has become Biden’s – and the larger Democrat Party’s – “de facto state media,” Gingrich wrote.Follow @tdwilliamsrome
