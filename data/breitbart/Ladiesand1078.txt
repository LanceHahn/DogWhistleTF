Ladies and gentlemen, please make sure your seat backs and tray tables are in their full upright position and your seatbelt is fastened. Today is the day Boeing is saying farewell to an icon: It’s delivering its final 747 jumbo jet and its now ready for one last take off.Since a maiden flight in 1969, the giant 747 has served the world as a cargo plane, a commercial aircraft capable of carrying nearly 500 passengers, a transport for NASA’s space shuttles, and the Air Force One presidential aircraft, AP reports.It revolutionized travel, connecting international cities that had never before had direct routes while helping democratize passenger flight, all while showcasing the very best in U.S. design innovation and manufacturing capabilities.Put simply, the 747 opened up the world to all travellers – not just the wealthy elites – after first revolutionizing commercial trans-Atlantic flights between New York and London.File/The first Boeing 747 is rolled out of the Boeing company’s plant in the State of Washington in September 1968 before the world’s press and representatives of the 26 airlines that had ordered the plane. The first flight took place on February 09, 1969. The Boeing 747, called also “Jumbo Jet”, entered service on January 21, 1970, on Pan Am’s New York to London route.

It debuted shortly before the oil crisis of 1973, amid a recession that saw Boeing’s employment fall from 100,800 employees in 1967 to a low of 38,690 in April 1971.File/1968: A full sized mock-up of Boeing’s 747 original aircraft complete with passengers.

This was a straight shot — and reasonably priced.”Delta was the last U.S. airline to use the 747 for passenger flights, which ended in 2017, although some other international carriers continue to fly it, including the German airline Lufthansa.Atlas Air ordered four 747-8 freighters early last year, with the final one leaving the factory Tuesday.Read the full AP tribute to the 747 here
