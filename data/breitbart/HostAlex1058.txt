Host Alex Marlow begins today’s podcast with the media doubling down claiming a black man who was beaten by black cops is an example of white supremacy. It makes you lose faith in the country, but then your faith is restored by the epic story of Bass the hero dog who survived four combat deployments and over 350 missions. Alex gives you the details to cleanse the pallet. Also in Alex’s opening: migrants are squatting in luxury New York City hotels, another debt ceiling battle is looming, the 2024 primary seems to be picking up steam, and more.
