Everything about this is infuriating.”O’Donnell said, “California has the strictest gun laws in the U.S.”Newsom said, “I mean, the Second Amendment has become a suicide pact.”O’Donnell said, “But there are many in this country that support the Second Amendment and are lawful gun owners.”Newsom said, “Yeah, I have great respect. I have no ideological opposition to someone reasonably and responsibly owning firearms and getting background checks and being trained.”O’Donnell said, “How did  he get a gun that is illegal in the state of California?”Newsom said, “We will figure it out.
