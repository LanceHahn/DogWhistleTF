All Britons should delete TikTok off their phones to protect themselves from being spied upon by Communist China, a senior MP has said.Alicia Kearns, the Conservative Party MP who serves as the head of the UK’s foreign affairs select committee warned on Sunday that there was now significant evidence that TikTok was being used to gather the data of individual users in the UK for intelligence purposes.The MP claims that such information gathering poses a significant threat to those in the UK, with the Tory party politician going on to advise all Britons to delete the app from their phone in order to protect themselves.“Now this isn’t just me saying ‘I’m worried, delete it’, we have evidence that TikTok has been used to track down sources for journalists,” she told UK broadcaster Sky News during an interview.“Sophy get off it!

Seth Moulton becoming one of the latest American politicians to criticise the app last week, describing it as a “threat” to American families and national security.“[L]et me just speak for a second as a dad, I don’t want an app that steals my daughter’s data and influences their behaviour on their phones,” he told CNN. “That’s exactly what TikTok does. And so, it is a threat, not just to our national security, writ large, but frankly, to American families.”Meanwhile, the Dutch government has banned the social media site from being installed on government devices, even advising its own civil servants to stay off the platform for fear of its data-gathering potential.It is reported that authorities in the Netherlands told departments last week to “suspend the use of TikTok for the government until TikTok has adjusted its data protection policy”, with the state to cease all advertising and communications on the China-owned platform.EU Official Threatens to Ban TikTok if it Fails to Censor Content https://t.co/VufEKSa6HK— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 22, 2023
