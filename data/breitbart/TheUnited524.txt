He said:Vladimir Putin’s aggression cannot be seen in any way to have been sucessful. And that’s why we have accelerated and increased our support militarily for Ukraine this year, a decision I took as Prime Ministeer.Today we go even further, not just providing Challenger Tanks and being one of the first countries to do so, which catalysed the provision of tanks from other nations as well, but also today to move to start training Ukranian Marines in the advanced capabilities they need to mount further offensives. But also to train their pilots on advanced combat aircraft.It is reported this training for jet pilots will specifically be on “NATO-standard fighter jets”, which makes clear — if true — that Western donations of some of the world’s most impactful and advanced weapons systems to Ukraine is on the horizon. The training of Ukrainian pilots to operate jet fighters also squares the circle of how Western allies can boost Ukraine’s air defence and offence without becoming directly involved themselves, by deploying NATO pilots.Ukraine Prez Zelensky touched down on a military jet in London Wednesday morning, making a rare surprise trip abroad in a bid to get more advanced weapons which will see meetings with parliament and King Charles III https://t.co/cM6otv3q8Q— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 8, 2023The revelation of training for Ukrainian pilots comes just days after Kyiv (Kiev) expressed his confidence that Western nations would indeed agree to hand over fighter jets, pointing out Ukraine had already been given everything else it asked for so far. More than 10,000 Ukrainian troops have already been trained in the UK in agreements that even predate the present war, on using equipment from man-portable anti-tank missiles to main battle tanks.The Associated Press reported Wednesday morning that the purpose of Zelensky’s surprise trip to London was a “bid for more advanced weapons” in anticipation of a fresh Russian offensive.Fighter jets do not appear to be the end of Ukraine’s “wish list to Santa”, however, with recent requests running to an attack submarine and a naval frigate to allow the country to assert control over the Black Sea, and long-range missiles.'There Will Be Planes' – Ukraine Claims Western Jets Already a Done Deal https://t.co/7fuwgzmXKK— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 5, 2023
