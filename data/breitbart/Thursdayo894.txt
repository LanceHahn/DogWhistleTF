You saw this all over the place.HEWITT: Correct.TRUMP: And she said I’ll never run against my president. He’s a great president. He’s been our greatest president. I’ll never run. I’ll never run. But Nikki suffers from something that’s a very tough thing to suffer from. She’s overly ambitious.HEWITT: You know, Mike Pompeo says in his book that she asked you to become the Vice President in place of Mike Pence in the 2020 election. Is that true?TRUMP: It’s absolutely false. That who asked me? Nikki Haley asked me to be Vice President?HEWITT: Yeah, that’s in, according to John Kelly. That didn’t happen?TRUMP: Can you imagine? That I would run as Vice President to Nikki Haley?HEWITT: No, no, Nikki Haley asked you if she could be your vice presidential nominee in 2020.TRUMP: Oh, I thought you said that she asked me if I’d be her vice president. That would be, that would be a big story.HEWITT: No, no. Did she…TRUMP: If anybody would say yes, I did, you should immediately take that person off your list as ridiculous. Okay, no, I did not ask her at all to be vice president. Nope, never mentioned it to her.HEWITT: And she didn’t bring it up to you?TRUMP: I don’t want to say that. I’m not going to embarrass her, but I have never asked her to be vice president.Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
