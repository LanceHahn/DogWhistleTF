Both Democrat and Republican senators on Thursday hailed President Joe Biden’s decision to send 31 Abrams main battle tanks to Ukraine in the face of decreasing American public backing for indefinite support for the embattled country.Biden characterized the decision as helping to “defend” Ukraine, amid concerns it is an escalatory move in the nearly one-year long war, which began when Russia invaded Ukraine last February.“That’s what this is about: helping Ukraine defend and protect Ukrainian land. It is not an offensive threat to Russia. We are — there is no offensive threat to Russia,” Biden said.A poll released last month by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs showed that while 65 percent of Americans supported supplying Ukraine with weapons, only 48 percent said the U.S. should support Ukraine for “as long as it takes” — a 10 percent drop from July.Biden announced Wednesday afternoon he has approved sending 31 Abrams M1 main battle tanks to Ukraine, in an escalation of U.S. support for the war as it nears the one-year mark. https://t.co/fx60Tkga3e— Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) January 25, 2023The tanks came as part of a package that brings U.S. military assistance to over $27.8 billion and overall U.S. aid to Ukraine to more than $113 billion since the beginning of the war.Nonetheless, there were few voices of dissent over Biden’s decision from the Senate.The Senate’s No. 2 Democrat Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) tweeted: “I’m in strong support of @POTUS sending these tanks in step with our European allies to help repel Russia.”For almost a year, the Ukrainian people have put up a valiant defense against Russia’s illegal and brutal war. I'm in strong support of @POTUS sending these tanks in step with our European allies to help repel Russia. https://t.co/nKYnKTBng6— Senator Dick Durbin (@SenatorDurbin) January 25, 2023Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE), a close Biden ally, tweeted, “Great news. … I’m glad President Biden is continuing to give them the tools they need as they prepare for a spring counteroffensive.”Great news. The Ukrainian people are fighting with unmatched courage and determination. I’m glad President Biden is continuing to give them the tools they need as they prepare for a spring counteroffensive. https://t.co/kYtzbiuHKj— Senator Chris Coons (@ChrisCoons) January 25, 2023Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) tweeted, “Significant, strong show of support. American tanks will be instrumental in the spring offensive against Putin’s barbaric assault.”Significant, strong show of support for Ukraine. American Abrams tanks will be instrumental in the spring offensive against Putin’s barbaric assault. With the proper military weaponry & Ukrainian’s dogged determination, they can—& will—win. https://t.co/7zPC8WR34H— Richard Blumenthal (@SenBlumenthal) January 25, 2023Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) tweeted, “By sending tanks to the brave Ukrainians fighting for their freedom, we’re joining our allies and committing to provide aid where we can to help make sure Putin loses this war that he chose.”.@POTUS has worked tirelessly to keep the NATO alliance together in supporting Ukraine. By sending tanks to the brave Ukrainians fighting for their freedom, we’re joining our allies and committing to provide aid where we can to help make sure Putin loses this war that he chose.🇺 https://t.co/7rMqFunsPT— Tammy Duckworth (@SenDuckworth) January 25, 2023Sen. Gary Peters (D-MI) tweeted, “During WWII, Michigan was the ‘Arsenal of Democracy. Now we’re defending democracy abroad again by helping to build these tanks — which will support Ukrainian efforts in Russia’s illegal war. We stand with Ukraine & Michiganders of Ukrainian descent.”During WWII, Michigan was the “Arsenal of Democracy.” Now we're defending democracy abroad again by helping to build these tanks –– which will support Ukrainian efforts in Russia’s illegal war.We stand with Ukraine & Michiganders of Ukrainian descent. https://t.co/oG3EOAT27L— Senator Gary Peters (@SenGaryPeters) January 25, 2023Although there was one Republican lone voice that criticized the decision — Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) — other Republicans hailed the decision and said it was long overdue.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), the top Republican in the Senate said in a statement, “I was happy to learn yesterday and this morning that, indeed, both the White House and their counterparts in Germany are finally moving forward with these overdue steps.”“Modern Main Battle Tanks will provide highly maneuverable, armored firepower that will help Ukraine liberate territory and keep pressure on the Russian aggressors, but time is of the essence,” he said, calling on the West to do more. He also called for “serious work to expand the capacity of our defense industrial base.”Sen. Roger Wicker (R-MS), member of the Armed Services Committee, also called it a “welcome development,” and said the decision “should have been made months ago.”The provision of a significant quantity of tanks from both the United States and Germany is a welcome development, but it is important for Congress to ensure that we follow through on this commitment.— Senator Roger Wicker (@SenatorWicker) January 25, 2023Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) said, “The correct decision again comes too late.”The correct decision again comes too late.President Biden’s hesitance to send tanks to Ukraine has prolonged this war, raising the cost and death toll. pic.twitter.com/L8tcn0SxcF— Tom Cotton (@SenTomCotton) January 25, 2023Sen.
