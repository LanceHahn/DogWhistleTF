The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is considering relaxing a proposal that would require companies to disclose the alleged effects of extreme weather and climate change.The Wall Street Journal first reported that the Wall Street regulator is revisiting the financial report part of its climate disclosure proposal. The SEC will likely make the disclosures less onerous than originally proposed, which may include increasing the threshold for which companies have to report climate costs.“In addition to the financial-reporting rules, SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s climate proposals would require publicly traded companies to disclose the greenhouse-gas emissions from their operations, energy consumption and — in some cases — suppliers and customers,” the Journal noted.SEC weighs raising the proposed threshold at which companies would have to disclose weather or climate-related hits. Current language would capture anything that exceeds 1% of any line item in financial statements (ie revenue, inventories, cost of sales). https://t.co/atqq7PK84o— Paul Kiernan (@pkwsj) February 3, 2023The SEC would have required companies to collect a substantial amount of data surrounding how climate change may affect a company’s bottom line:Gensler’s climate proposals are likely to face significant backlash from industry groups and Republicans. SEC officials were reportedly “taken aback” by the strength of the opposition to their climate disclosure proposal.For instance, Amazon said that the disclosure proposal would be “extremely difficult, if not impossible.”Sean Moran is a policy reporter for Breitbart News.
