Andy Ogles (R-TN) yelled during the speech.Meanwhile, Biden’s Homeland Security chief Alejandro Mayorkas claims that the administration is “doing that which needs to be done” to stop it, while critics say the administration is not putting enough pressure on Mexico.According to a recent government report, drug overdose deaths likely exceeded 107,000 from August 2021 to August 2022.
