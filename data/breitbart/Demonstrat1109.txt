One investigation revealed that AbbVie Pharmaceuticals, which makes a drug that is commonly used as a puberty blocker, was listed as a sponsor of a pro-trans organization that secures media appearances for children who are attempting to change their sex.The Tennessee State Legislature is set to consider a bill that would ban the use of puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and sex change surgeries on youth who are experiencing gender dysphoria. The bill was introduced by Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson (R) and House Majority Leader William Lamberth (R).Spencer Lindquist is a reporter for Breitbart News.
