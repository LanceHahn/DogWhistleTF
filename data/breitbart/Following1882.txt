Following the proposal of San Francisco’s reparations committee to pay longtime black residents billions of dollars in reparations, Utah’s Republican 4th District Rep. Burgess Owens slammed the conversation as “condescending,” arguing it “conveys a racist narrative that Black Americans are a hopeless, hapless, and oppressed race who need pity and handouts to succeed.”In an exclusive statement to Breitbart News on Wednesday, Owens, who won reelection in November, responded to the notion of reparations in light of the recent plan put forth by the city of San Francisco to grant $5 million to each black longtime resident, as well as total debt forgiveness, in light of decades of alleged “systematic repression” faced by the black community.“While neither San Francisco, nor California, formally adopted the institution of chattel slavery, the tenets of segregation, white supremacy and systematic repression and exclusion of Black people were codified through legal and extralegal actions, social codes, and judicial enforcement,” the San Francisco African American Reparations Advisory Committee’s draft reads.Owens, a former NFL legend and Super Bowl Champion, pushed back against the “counterproductive” proposal, accusing Democrats of attempting to use the matter to “deflect” from their own failures.“The conversation of reparations is condescending, counterproductive, illogical, logistically impossible and deflects from Democrats’ overwhelming success in propagating misery,” he said.Owens also slammed the “racist narrative” such a move perpetuates.File/Utah Rep.
