This is something that must get done.”She also urged Republicans and Democrats to work together in a spirit of bipartisanship to raise the debt limit.“We believe when it comes to the debt limit, it has been done in a bipartisan way over the years and decades. And it should be done in a bipartisan way. And it should be done without conditions,” she said.
