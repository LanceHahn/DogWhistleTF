And I think it is important that it is understood, not just in Moscow, but is understood in places like Beijing — that unprovoked aggression against your neighbors is not something the United States and its allies would tolerate.”Commenting on Trump’s influence in the Republican Party, Bolton said: “I think Trump support within the party itself is in terminal decline.”Bolton served as Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Affairs from 2001 to 2005, then was appointed U.S. ambassador to the U.N., while also campaigning for the Iraq War as director of the Project for the New American Century.Under Trump, Bolton served from April 2018 to September 2019 as national security adviser, two years after he was overlooked as a potential secretary of state.He has never sought to disguise his antipathy towards Trump in the years since they parted ways.John Bolton: "I think he did incite this mob, with the clear intention of having them disrupt the Electoral College certification, and delay it to give him more time.” https://t.co/4UMbyWxtkb— Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) January 9, 2021Trump has said he fired Bolton, while Bolton claims he resigned, as Breitbart News reported.Trump remains the only Republican to announce their candidacy for the 2024 election, while Florida Gov.
