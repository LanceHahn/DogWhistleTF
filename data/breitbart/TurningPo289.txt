Many of the cases have involved speech that has an intimidating effect that implies a threat to use violence, such as burning a cross.The original 1909 statute intended to punish efforts to threaten and intimidate voters, including in disguise, such as the Ku Klux Klan. It has since been amended several times, but not in ways that would resolve the First Amendment issues that it raises.The statute has been cited in defense of free speech, as in 2016, when conservative law professor and pundit Glenn Reynolds argued that Democrat officials’ threats (including by then-California Attorney General Kamala Harris) to investigate political donations to groups that are skeptical of climate change amounted to a violation of the law.Breitbart News will continue to follow the story of Mackey’s arrest and future trial.You can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Facebook and Twitter at @ARmastrangelo, and on Instagram.
