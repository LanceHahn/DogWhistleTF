This campaign will be about issues, ” he later said. “Joe Biden has put America on the fast track to ruin and destruction, and we will ensure that he does not receive four more years.”TRUMP: "We need a fighter who can stand up to the left, stand up to the swamp, stand up to the media, stand up to the deep state.
