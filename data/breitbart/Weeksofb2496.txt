Weeks of bombarding the world with breathless claims of victimhood while delivering previews, book leaks, complaints, threats, and bitter recriminations against his own family have done Prince Harry no favours with the British public, a poll released Monday shows.The survey, undertaken by more than 1,600 adults between January 5 and 6, reveals the duke’s net favourability now sits at a humbling -38.His popularity has sunk to the record low on the back of the non-stop controversy, according to data analysed by YouGov as seen by the Evening Standard.Almost two-thirds (64 percent) of Britons have a negative view of Harry, up from 58 percent in May, with just a quarter (26 percent) seeing him in a positive light, according to the YouGov figures.The results come ahead of the release of Harry’s book Spare, due out on Tuesday, which has sparked a furore, following claims the Prince of Wales physically attacked him while detailing just how he lost his virginity in a paddock behind a pub.Too Much Information!
