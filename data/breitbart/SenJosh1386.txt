Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) unveiled legislation on Wednesday that would ban TikTok on American devices and ban commercial activity from TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance.“TikTok poses a threat to all Americans who have the app on their devices,” Hawley said in a written statement on Wednesday. “It opens the door for the Chinese Communist Party to access Americans’ personal information, keystrokes, and location through aggressive data harvesting. Banning it on government devices was a step in the right direction, but now is the time to ban it nationwide to protect the American people.”Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO) introduced the House version of the legislation. He said in a statement:TikTok is a clear threat to our privacy and national security. Not only is TikTok directly associated with the Chinese Communist Party, but it has been used to spy on Americans and gain an alarming level of access to users’ phones. This should concern every citizen who values their privacy, security, and personal information. Banning CCP tied TikTok nationwide is the only route to ending this malicious cybersecurity threat.

Josh Hawley to ensure that every Americans’ privacy and security is protected from hostile foreign entities.The bill, formally known as the No TikTok on United States Devices Act, according to Hawley’s office, would:Hawley teased on Tuesday that he would introduce the legislation to ban TikTok, saying the app violates Americans’ privacy.Hawley’s legislation to ban Tiktok on government devices was included in the $1.7 trillion omnibus bill that was passed in late December, a rare bright spot for conservatives in the mammoth 4,155-page bill.Hawley and Sen.
