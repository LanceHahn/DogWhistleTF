Chairman @RepJamesComer, let’s get to work!— Rep. Lauren Boebert (@RepBoebert) January 17, 2023The Steering Committee selections will have to be approved by a vote from the entire House Republican conference, which “typically approves the Steering Committee’s recommendations,” according to The Hill.In the weeks leading up to the 118th Congress, Biden’s White House announced they would not co comply with GOP oversight requests until they officially took majority control of the House.However, Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY) has recently begun probing President Joe Biden’s handling of classified documents after reports that several boxes of White House records from his tenure as vice president were found in multiple locations.Reps. Green and Gosar’s appointments to the Oversight Committee are significant because both members were stripped of their committee assignments by Democrats during the previous Congress.House Democrats in February 2021, just one month after she took office, voted to remove Green from her committee assignments amid controversy surrounding her social media activity.Then, in November 2021, House Democrats voted to remove Gosar from his committee assignments, which included the Oversight Committee, after he posted a controversial anime edited video to his Twitter account.Along with investigating Biden’s handling of classified documents, the Republican-led Oversight Committee has also pledged to investigate the Biden White House for several things, including the ongoing border and fentanyl crises, the energy crisis, Biden’s withdrawal from Afghanistan, Hunter Biden’s business dealings, and the origins of the coronavirus.The Biden White House is obstructing congressional investigations into:❌border & fentanyl crises❌energy crisis❌Afghanistan withdrawal❌COVID origins❌Biden family's influence peddlingWe are undeterred.
