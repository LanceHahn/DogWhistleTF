Michigan Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D) made clear she and her legislative colleagues will be acting “soon” for more gun control in the wake of the attack at Michigan State University.The MSU attack was carried out by a 43-year-old man who faced a felony gun charge in 2019, but was instead allowed to take probation for a misdemeanor.Had the felony charges been pursued, the 43-year-old would have been barred from gun possession for life.The Detroit News reported Brinks says the Michigan Senate will “take action soon.”Brinks added, “We will be introducing common-sense legislation and we are prepared to get the job done.”Democratic Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks, left, and House Speaker Joe Tate talk during inauguration ceremonies, Sunday, Jan. 1, 2023, outside the state Capitol in Lansing, Mich.
