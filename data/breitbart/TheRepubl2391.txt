The Republican-led United States House of Representatives voted to repeal the billions Democrats desired to spend on an army of IRS agents, as House Speaker Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) identified the action as the “very first act of the new Congress.”“House Republicans just voted unanimously to repeal the Democrats’ army of 87,000 IRS agents. This was our very first act of the new Congress, because government should work for you, not against you. Promises made. Promises kept,” McCarthy announced Monday night:🚨 House Republicans just voted unanimously to repeal the Democrats' army of 87,000 IRS agents 🚨This was our very first act of the new Congress, because government should work for you, not against you.Promises made.

The $80 billion increase over the next decade had come under severe scrutiny, as conservatives warned that a fleet of IRS agents would target everyday Americans.Congress initially passed the $700 billion “Inflation Reduction Act” in August 2022, a law which would not actually reduce inflation but grow government in a variety of ways, including expanding the IRS with $80 billion. Such action would make it a bigger agency than “the Pentagon, State Department, FBI, and Border Patrol combined,” as Breitbart News detailed.During a December appearance on Jesse Watters Primetime, then-GOP leader McCarthy stated that the Republican-led House would vote to repeal the 87,000 IRS agents “on the very first day.”
