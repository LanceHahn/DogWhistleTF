In addition, he must undergo a sex offender program and log 200 hours of community service. However, he was not ordered to register as a sex offender after victimizing the little girls.Shei reportedly raped the nine-year-old at a home in Rochester in 2018, and raped the other child several times at the same home during the same time frame. However, the man denied raping the child.“There is no moving on or getting over it. I’ve tried,” one of the victims said of her experience in court this week before breaking down and crying.Meanwhile, the majority of American voters place blame at the feet of “woke politicians” for the ongoing crime wave plaguing the nation under President Joe Biden’s (D) leadership, according to an October poll.“The latest Harvard/Harris Poll shows that 64 percent of voters say woke politicians are responsible for an increase in crime across American communities, while only 36 percent blame ‘other factors,'” Breitbart News reported at the time.
