Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) touted his “ABORTION” pin, styled with a heart, calling to codify abortion as a “right.”The far-left senator’s pin was from Planned Parenthood, and he called the killing of unborn babies “essential healthcare.”I’m wearing my abortion pin from @PPFA to tonight’s State of the Union address. Abortion is essential healthcare and we need to codify this right. pic.twitter.com/ZfNj5OEZcj— Ed Markey (@SenMarkey) February 8, 2023SBA Pro-Life America replied to the tweet, calling the move “SICK.”During the State of the Union address, President Joe Biden called to codify Roe v. Wade — the infamous abortion case that was overturned over the summer of 2022 — and threatened to veto any abortion ban that comes to his desk.“Abortion is health care, regardless if you live in a red or blue state, and today’s ruling must be an urgent call to action for my Senate colleagues,” Markey said in response to Roe‘s reversal.Markey supports taxpayer-funded elective abortion and cosponsored the so-called “Women’s Health Protection Act” which codifies unlimited ability to kill a child until the moment of birth.He also voted against a measure to prohibit taxpayer funding for abortions for unborn babies diagnosed with Down syndrome, as well as many other bills protecting the unborn.
