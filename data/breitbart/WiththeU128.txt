With the U.S. inflation accelerating in January, despite the efforts to bring down the price hikes with higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve, many consumer categories are still being hit hard.Here are some of the worst consumer categories still being hit hard by inflation:As noted by Breitbart News’ John Carney on Tuesday, the consumer price index (CPI), which measures what consumers pay for goods and services from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, rose 0.5 percent in January compared with a month earlier. The CPI increased by one-tenth of a point in December after rising twice in November.However, over the last 12 months, CPI has been up 6.4 percent, down from 6.5 percent in December and 7.1 percent in November.Jacob Bliss is a reporter for Breitbart News.
