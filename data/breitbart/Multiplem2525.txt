The spokesman said the actions are part of a “layered approach hat includes patrolling the border itself, nearby areas and neighborhoods, and conducting checkpoints.”El Paso Matters wrote: “The sounds of crowds of people talking, crying, laughing and praying around the streets of Downtown El Paso were silenced overnight Wednesday as U.S. Border Patrol agents swept up large crowds of migrants near the Greyhound bus terminal.”“By Thursday morning, all that remained were sidewalks lined with piles of blankets, clothes and toys – which were thrown away by city crews who quickly swept and cleaned up the area,” the report continued.

The White House did not disclose in advance who the president will meet with and what he plans to visit during the border trip.The New York Times stated that Biden’s visit to El Paso “is bound to be awkward.
