So I’ve seen the very best of our country. People here threw out the old, tired political establishment and demanded accountability for their tax dollars. Industry reports called us the ‘Beast of the Southeast,’ which I love. People came by the thousands for fresh starts. Moms and dads held their heads up high. Children learned that it was always a great day in South Carolina,” she said, contending that Republicans have “lost the popular vote in seven out of the last eight presidential elections. That has to change.”“It’s time for a new generation of leadership to rediscover fiscal responsibility, secure our border and strengthen our country our pride and our purpose,” she added:Get excited!
