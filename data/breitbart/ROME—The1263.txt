ROME — The machete-wielding Moroccan jihadist Yassine Kanjaa who attacked Christians at church in southern Spain this week had been under a deportation order since June that was never acted upon, Associated Press reports.As Breitbart News reported, Kanjaa assailed Christians in two Spanish churches with a machete Wednesday while shouting “Allahu akbar” and “Death to Christians,” killing one and wounding at least four more.On Thursday, Spanish police raided Kanjaa’s home and are treating the attack as an act of Islamic terrorism.Kanjaa had been under a deportation order since June of 2022 because of his unauthorized migrant status in Spain, but authorities failed to carry the order out.A funeral mass takes place with the coffin of the church sacristan who was attacked and killed Wednesday in Algeciras, Spain, Friday, Jan. 27, 2023.
