ROME — Pope Francis voiced his “sadness” Sunday over the imprisonment of Nicaraguan Bishop Rolando Álvarez, who has been sentenced to 26 years of jail time by the regime of dictator Daniel Ortega.“The news from Nicaragua has saddened me a great deal, and I cannot but remember with concern Bishop Rolando Álvarez of Matagalpa, whom I care about greatly, sentenced to 26 years imprisonment, and also those who have been deported to the United States,” the pontiff told the faithful gathered in Saint Peter’s Square for his weekly Angelus address.On Friday, the Ortega government found the 57-year-old Bishop Álvarez guilty of treason against the homeland, undermining national integrity, and spreading fake news, stripping him of his Nicaraguan citizenship.Álvarez was found guilty of crimes against laws approved by the National Assembly in 2021 as a juridical framework to accuse and sentence political dissidents who have stood up to the Ortega regime.File/Nuns attend a Mass at the Cathedral in Matagalpa, Nicaragua, Friday, Aug. 19, 2022.
