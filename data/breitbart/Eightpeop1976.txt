There were 1,000-plus people here at the event, and as the shots rang out, people were just running in all directions.”He added, “Multiple people were shot, it sounds like from our initial investigation here on scene there was a disagreement of some sort between two parties, and unfortunately, they chose to resolve that with guns.”TCPalm noted eight adults were wounded in the incident, one of them critically.Four others, including one child, were injured during their attempt to flee the scene.Deputy Hester believes there were two shooters involved in the incident.AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.
