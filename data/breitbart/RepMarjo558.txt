Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) interrupted President Joe Biden’s 2023 State of the Union address to call him a “liar” after he claimed Republicans want to “sunset” Social Security and Medicare. “Instead of making the wealthy pay their fair share, some Republicans want Medicare and Social Security to sunset. I’m not saying it’s the majority,” Biden claimed. President Biden: "Instead of making the wealthy pay their fair share, some Republicans want Medicare and Social Security to sunset.
