A disappointed U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres warned the Davos elites Wednesday any moves to increase fossil fuel production are “inconsistent with human survival” and governments must join with the private sector to eliminate their use.Guterres, who presumably flew into the luxury Swiss ski resort on a fossil fuel-burning private jet like so many in his World Economic Forum (WEF) audience, remains in no doubt the future of the planet is in peril.“We are in the worst situation of my lifetime,” the veteran Portuguese socialist declared before pointing at the corporate leaders and politicians before him as he said they are far from blameless, Politico reports.“Across the spectrum of global challenges, we need private sector resourcefulness and cooperation to advance peace, sustainable development and human rights,” he said, continuing to air a theme of grievances he advanced from the day of his arrival.U.N.
