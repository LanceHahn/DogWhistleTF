Update: This story has been updated to include a statement from Rep. Scott Perry’s office saying the report that Perry would back Rep. Hakeem Jeffries for speaker is false. This story has also been updated to reflect that Rep. Matt Gaetz is not a member of the House Freedom Caucus.In a private meeting with McCarthy to negotiate voting for him to become House speaker, Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO), Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), and House Freedom Caucus chair Rep. Scott Perry (R-PA) said they want to form their own legal entity in the new Congress to wage lawsuits, according to Punchbowl News.As all three lawmakers appear to be voting against McCarthy to become speaker, the publication noted that the group also told the Republican leader that they don’t mind if the speaker’s vote on Tuesday goes to a plurality and Jeffries is elected to the highest position because they will “fight him.”MORE NEWS — In a private mtg yesterday, GAETZ, BOEBERT, PERRY told McCarthy they wanted their OWN legal entity in House to wage lawsuits. The group also told McCarthy that they don’t mind if the speaker vote goes to plurality and @RepJeffries is elected bc they’ll fight him. https://t.co/UMSJX0DmFI— Jake Sherman (@JakeSherman) January 3, 2023Perry’s office responded in a statement to Breitbart News that the notion that he would ever back Jeffries is a “blatant lie.”Perry said:Reportedly, McCarthy also asked his opposers, who are mostly in the House Freedom Caucus, to present their offer to the entire Republican Conference in a closed meeting on Tuesday morning since he did not see the offer as viable. If McCarthy made such a request, it may have been his way of taking his fight with the Freedom Caucus — which has been brewing for over a decade — to them by making it happen in front of the whole conference.Their offer reportedly included specific committee assignments for many people in their caucus, along with subcommittee chairs, and “amnesty” after the entire negotiation with McCarthy.On the way to the meeting with the Republican Conference, McCarthy told Punchbowl that his goal for today would be to “unite the team.”“Explain what we went through,” he continued. “The difficult part here is we went out to the American public with a commitment to America to fight for them, not for a few members here to fight for their own personal. This is about the country, and we’ll have to show the difference.”🚨🚨🚨NEWS — I just caught up w @GOPLeader on his way into the party meeting. I asked him what his goal is today He is planning to take it to the House Freedom Caucus even though he’s down votes. pic.twitter.com/PavJV2qSNW— Jake Sherman (@JakeSherman) January 3, 2023Jacob Bliss is a reporter for Breitbart News.
