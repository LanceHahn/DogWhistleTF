Disgraced FTX Founder and Democrat super donor Sam Bankman-Fried, who is set to plead not guilty in a New York court on Tuesday, has reportedly asked the judge to keep his bail guarantors a secret. SBF’s lawyers argued that there is “no need for public disclosure” of who is paying to keep the crypto kingpin accused of fraud out of jail.Bankman-Fried’s lawyers argued that there is “no need for public disclosure” of the identities of two people who will help secure the disgraced FTX founder’s bail in order to protect them from potential scrutiny and harassment, according to a report by Bloomberg.FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried (second on left) is led away in handcuffs by officers of the Royal Bahamas Police Force in Nassau, Bahamas, on December 13, 2022.

Bankman-Fried then put his 12,000-square ft. penthouse in the Bahamas up for sale.In just the course of one week in November, Bankman-Fried went from having an estimated net worth of $16 billion to being completely broke, with Bloomberg referring to the incident as “one of history’s greatest-ever destructions of wealth.”You can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Facebook and Twitter at @ARmastrangelo, and on Instagram.
