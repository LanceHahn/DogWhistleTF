A record number of British adults are still living at home with their parents as younger generations put off marriage and raising children, the country’s official statistician revealed on Friday.According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) there were some 4.9 million adults living in the same home as their parents in 2021, the highest figure on record and an increase of 14.7 per cent over just ten years ago.The jump was recorded across the board, with all age groups seeing an increase, however the largest rise was seen among 25 to 29-year-olds.London, where house prices are sky high and social housing in short supply, was the most impacted region, with many boroughs of the capital recording over 30 per cent increases in non-dependant adults living at home.4.9 million non-dependent children lived in the parental home in March 2021 – an increase of 14.7% since 2011.The largest increase was for those aged 25 to 29. ➡️ https://t.co/oQ4GoJLWrB pic.twitter.com/3RCkLt0yxv— Office for National Statistics (ONS) (@ONS) February 9, 2023The ONS attributed the concerning rise in part to the fact that young adults are increasingly delaying major life milestones such as getting married and having children. The statistician also pointed to the Chinese coroanvirus crisis as a likely contributor to the rise in 2021.However, this has been a longstanding trend, with 50 per cent of people in 2017 waiting until they were 23 to leave home, compared to over 50 per cent of 21-year-olds having already moved out two decades prior.Steve Smallwood, demography topic lead at the ONS, said: “We can see that there has been a significant increase in grown-up children living with their parents, with over half of those aged 19 to 23 doing so.”The ONS also found that those living together as a couple, but not in a marriage or civil partnernship, has increased from 20.6 per cent in 2011 to 24.3 per cent in 2021.The reason why two-thirds of Britons support capping immigration is the pressure it puts on the NHS, schooling, and housing says @MigrationWatch ’s Alp Mehmet.
