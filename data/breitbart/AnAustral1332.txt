An Australian professional basketball team opted out of wearing a gay pride jersey after its coach claimed members were “targeted” and harassed.The Cairns Taipans of Australia’s National Basketball League posted a message to Twitter on Wednesday insisting that as a team, they still support the LGBTQ agenda but opted out of wearing the league-approved jersey because team members were “shamed,” Fox News reported.It appears that it was the players who were uninterested in wearing the gay pride jersey and were the subject of the attacks because they would not wear the shirts. Ultimately, the team decided none of them would wear the jersey to close ranks around the religious players who were being persecuted., the Daily Mail reported.In the statement, the team said they are “pleased” to participate n the “Champion Pride Round” and support the league’s “promotion of inclusion and diversity.”But the statement added, “our team has already been subjected to a barrage of abuse and harmful commentary that has led to individuals being targeted and shamed.”The CQUniversity Cairns Taipans share this message on behalf of the playing group. pic.twitter.com/i11zdfyfbj— Cairns Taipans (@CairnsTaipans) January 25, 2023“This is a negative distraction to what should be a positive experience across the game, and now we feel as though our only choice as a team is to collectively opt out of this season’s uniforms.“This is not a reflection of our individual stances or personal views, but a protection of our brothers that are being set up to be vilified and no longer feel as though they have a safe space in our sport.“Positive change requires positive action, and we believe we can champion different people and groups in our society without persecuting others in the process.”The Champion’s Pride Progress flag x ‘C’ logo is seen ahead of NBL inaugural Pride Round during the round 17 NBL match between South East Melbourne Phoenix and Cairns Taipans at State Basketball Centre, on January 25, 2023, in Melbourne, Australia.

Hence we have not mandated that our players have to wear the Pride jersey and if any player or team elect not to wear the jersey, we will respect that decision,” Kestelman concluded.The team did not elaborate on what sort of “targeting” and “vilification” team members faced.See that tiny ass logo on his chest?! That's what the Taipans refused to wear for Pride Round. You can't even see it on the broadcast.
