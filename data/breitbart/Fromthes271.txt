From the snowy peaks of Davos to the desert sands of the United Arab Emirates, unelected globalist elites like nothing better than to meet and discuss their plans for a future world  – designed, built and administered by them as part of the “4th industrial revolution.”The latest example begins Monday when World Economic Forum (WEF) founder and executive chairman Klaus Schwab joins the annual World Government Summit (WGS) 2023 in Dubai to deliver the keynote address.Just last year he greeted attendees at the Davos meeting of the WEF with a salute acknowledging the self-importance of those drawn to hear him speak and their role in shaping the world.“The future is not just happening. The future is built by us, by a powerful community as you here in this room. We have the means to improve the state of the world, but two conditions are necessary,” Schwab outlined.“The first one is that we act all as stakeholders of larger communities. That we serve not only self-interest but we serve the community. That’s what we call stakeholder responsibility. And second, that we collaborate.”In Dubai his keynote address at the World Government Summit continues that theme with the title: “The State of the World.”Tesla and Twitter CEO Elon Musk is also listed to speak, along with International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, joining representatives from the banking and finance industries amongst 10,000 others flying in to network under the overarching banner “Shaping Future Governments.”So too Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of World Health Organisation (WHO), who will discuss transitioning the world to digital health care.Nick Clegg, a former deputy prime minister of the UK and now president of global affairs at Meta, will speak in Dubai about AI-augmented governance.Among the other high-profile speakers are:The Gulf News reports the emirate sees itself becoming “the centre stage of exchange of ideas and visioning for a world facing numerous challenges” over the three-day meeting.File/Tesla CEO Elon Musk attends a panel discussion at the World Government Summit 2017 in Dubai’s Madinat Jumeirah on February 13, 2017.
