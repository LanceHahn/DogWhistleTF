Rep. Brian Mast (R-FL) introduced the Vaccine Mandate Reenlistment Act, which would essentially pave the way for those unfairly discharged from service due to the vaccine mandate to rejoin the military.According to a press release announcing the bill, it would “ensure that any soldier, sailor, Airman or Marine who was discharged for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine would be able to rejoin the military at his or her rank and pay grade prior to the discharge.” The release noted that an estimated 8,100 “soldiers, sailors, Airmen and Marines were discharged” as a result of the initial vaccine mandate. “We are facing multiple national security threats – now is not the time to play politics with servicemembers who are committed to serving the United States,” Mast said in a statement.Rep.

America’s military is the most lethal fighting force in the world – and this egregious COVID vaccine mandate hampered its readiness. Now, we must restore benefits for those wrongly discharged over the mandate.https://t.co/lAmtkTuGrj— Senator Ted Cruz (@SenTedCruz) January 11, 2023I am thrilled to report that the military COVID vaccine mandate is finally OVER thanks to the hard work of conservatives in Congress.
